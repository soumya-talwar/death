"move, move, move, move!"
yoongi shouts, voice tight with terror as he shoves at taehyung’s back and sends him tumbling towards the elevator.
taehyung’s shoulder collides with the metal doors and they vibrate from the impact.
he jams his blood-soaked fingers into the down arrow button frantically, and yoongi watches the glowing numbers above the doors count down once the elevator starts to descend the floors at a tortuous creeping pace.
whipping back around, yoongi sees the infected swarming into the hallway in masses.
he stumbles back on shaky legs and presses his back to taehyung's, holding his knife in front of him even though it is of no real use.
not when taehyung has a hand clamped around his bloody bicep where the bite sits, and not when they have neither the antidote nor a helpful firearm.
yoongi clamps his teeth shut when he feels a scream grow in his throat.
"how many floors?"
he hisses quietly.
"four," taehyung grunts out.
he sounds out of breath, and yoongi's eyes briefly dart to the wound on his arm that has bled through his shirt and painted it red.
the sight of it makes yoongi swallow hard, like if he dares to breathe too openly, he’ll scream.
"three," taehyung counts, voice hoarse.
yoongi feels taehyung’s back hunch over and tremble as he braces his forearms against the elevator doors to hold himself up.
they don't have long, and yoongi's face crumples when he recalls taehyung shoving him out of the way of the infected’s jaw only for it to sink its teeth into his own arm.
he closes his eyes for a second and blinks back the tears because they don’t have the fucking time for that.
despite their frightening numbers, the infected have terrible coordination and navigation skills due to their poor eyesight.
but yoongi swallows down the ugly sob building in his throat because they make up for their bad vision with terrifying auditory perception.
more of them continue to spill into the narrow hallway, stumbling and falling over each other in their blind haphazard attempts to locate them.
and yoongi instinctively leans back when one of them gets too close.
taehyung hisses in pain at the added weight.
"two," he strains his neck to whisper into yoongi’s ear, and yoongi tightens his grip around the hilt of his knife.
his hands are shaking uncontrollably and he can’t hear anything past the thundering of his heart, so hard and fast his chest hurts.
nineteen floors—they just need to reach the nineteenth floor in the little time they have.
seokjin had stored the vials of their experimental antidote in his office.
they hadn’t gotten an opportunity to test it yet so there’s no guarantee that it’ll work.
but with taehyung’s body shaking as he draws in terrifyingly shallow breaths, yoongi is left with very little options.
the seconds slowly crawl by, each one of them feeling like a lifespan of its own, and yoongi tries to will the wild throbbing of his heart.
he would call for help had he not lost his phone and all hopes of contact with the others along with it in the midst of the chaos.
"one," taehyung cautions under his breath.
a few of the infected have crawled closer, and something horrible and uneasy starts to slither under yoongi’s skin as the elevator creeps down slowly.
he feels taehyung lean away from the doors, and for a moment everything goes frightfully still.
like the world is holding its breath.
then yoongi hears the pleasant ding!
that announces the elevator’s arrival.
and like a lightning bolt, hundreds of necks crack and whip in their direction in eerie synchronization just as the elevator gives away their location.
yoongi’s eyes widen and then freeze stiff in horror.
the infected immediately start to crawl over one another with alarming speed in order to get to them first, and for a brief moment yoongi is rooted to his spot, fright locking his muscles tight in paralysis.
he wants to run, but he can’t move.
but then yoongi feels taehyung’s body twist behind him.
taehyung grips yoongi tight by the forearm, and with a sudden burst of strength, just about flings him inside the elevator.
yoongi lets out a loud broken scream when his head hits the wall and his shoulder is pushed into the floor hard.
his eyes fly open to see taehyung standing before the lift's doors.
he’s blocking the infected’s path to the elevator, his fingers curled tight around the hilt of the knife he’d snatched out of yoongi’s hand.
the doors begin to close, and all at once, yoongi is hit with the brutal realisation of what taehyung intends to do.
he watches the infected drag themselves over each other’s writhing bodies till one of them gets close, close enough to lunge at taehyung with its jaw hinged wide open.
and for one long bone-chilling moment, yoongi can’t move.
can’t breathe.
he feels the horror seize him tight by the throat and shove him down into the floor, one hand squeezing his throat and the other pushing down hard on his chest.
pushing and pushing till all air is forced out of his lungs and yoongi’s left gasping for breath.
taehyung drives the blade down the infected’s mouth, wedging it between its teeth to hold its jaw open as he hacks at it from the inside.
but there’s no way he can hold back the entire sea of infected bodies crawling towards him.
only an inch of a gap remains between the elevator doors.
stricken by a panicked urgency, yoongi pushes himself off the floor.
he wheezes—he can’t breathe, can’t suck in air when his stomach is clenched tight.
he scrambles up on his knees and dives forward just in time to shove a palm between the metal doors and keep them from closing in.
the doors jerk to a stop and then groan as they open once again.
yoongi falls forward on his palms as he tries to catch his breath.
he can see taehyung struggling to hold back the growing throng of infected bodies surging towards him.
one of them tries to bite down on his thigh but taehyung kicks it away with a boot to its face.
his injured arm is restraining his movements and keeping him from fighting like he typically would.
another infected grabs onto his bitten bicep.
its frame is so small that yoongi suspects it’s a girl no older than eleven.
but he has no room left inside him for sympathy.
he leaps up to his feet and surges forward to tear her off taehyung’s arm, tossing her to the side where she hits the wall with a loud crack and crumples.
taehyung whips around to look at him with startled eyes.
"why are you—" he starts but doesn’t get to finish what he’s saying because yoongi is lunging further forward to grab him by the back of his collar.
"you suicidal fucker," he spits and tugs at his shirt to wrench him back into the elevator, deaf to taehyung’s protests as he repeatedly slams his palm down on the button to close the elevator’s doors.
but it’s too slow, and more of the infected have crawled over the ones that fell before them.
one of them reaches forward with its hand and grabs the edge of the door to stop them from falling shut.
yoongi stumbles back and shoves taehyung towards the far end of the elevator.
taehyung cries out in pain when his arm collides against the wall.
yoongi blindly pats the floor behind him to reach for the knife as the infected pushes its way in and snarls at them, its spittle hitting yoongi in the face when it opens its jaw wide enough to bite their heads off their necks.
yoongi’s fingers finally curl around the familiar metal just as the infected lunges at him.
and he ducks to the side, falling hard on his elbow and biting down on his tongue to crush the scream that threatens to leave him.
the infected makes a horrible sound, something between a screech and a croak, and yoongi twists his torso to grab it by the hair from behind.
it thrashes in his hold, but yoongi jerks its head back to keep it from biting him.
it is easier to convince himself that the infected are no longer human; it certainly helps lift the weight of the guilt that comes crawling up to his chest in the deepest hours of the night and threatens to throttle him.
but no matter how much he wants to believe it, yoongi knows that they are still human.
the few experiments jimin and he had run have left no doubt that not only do they perceive pain just like the rest of them, the infected also possess sophisticated cognitive abilities to an extent.
but for all their tests, they still only know so much about them.
despite namjoon's persistent attempts to communicate with them, they’ve had little success.
the infected can talk, that is not the mystery, but nothing in their observed verbal repertoire seems to bear resemblance to any known language.
there have been instances of the infected displaying cooperative behavior as well, but with what little they know of their speech and cognition, it is hard to learn exactly how cooperation between them is possible.
all they know for certain is that the virus spreads via blood or bite, and that once it makes its journey to the head, it causes drastic mutations in the brain, ones that have never been observed before.
at this distance, yoongi can tell that the infected in his hold is a woman in her early twenties, and even though yoongi left his morals behind him long before the pandemic hit them, it certainly doesn’t make the job any easier.
it’s not his first time killing one of them, but it is seokjin or jungkook or taehyung who are typically sent out to assist in extermination or capture missions.
the thought of taehyung bleeding out on the floor not a meter away from him is what has yoongi driving his knee into the woman's spine to hold her still.
he takes the sharp edge of the knife and jams it into the carotid artery running along the side of her neck.
the woman thrashes harder and tries to twist out of his grasp, but yoongi grits his teeth and drags the knife in an arc to slice her trachea open.
a nauseating amount of blood seeps into his hand, but the woman stops moving, her horrifying noises dying once she collapses on the floor underneath him.
the relief is short-lived because yoongi immediately hears more of them behind him.
he pries out the bloody knife and twists around to see a crawling mass of bodies with twisted limbs and hideous hanging mouths.
on any other occasion, taehyung and he wouldn’t stand a chance with just a knife on them.
but due to the sheer number of infected bodies—each one of them trying to cram itself inside first—and the elevator’s entrance serving as a bottleneck, they’ve been able to hold out for this long.
and time is both a curse and a blessing because while they have so little of it, this delay is also their only way out.
the alarm starts blaring right at that moment.
after holding the doors for so long, the elevator is finally going to force itself shut.
"please stand clear of the closing doors," a mechanized voice announces before the doors start closing unprompted.
"yoongi!"
taehyung shouts at him.
"move!"
yoongi springs away from the entrance, taken by surprise by the sharp bark in taehyung’s voice, and he almost trips over the corpse behind him when there’s a sudden sound of a gunshot.
one of the infected falls back with a gaping hole in its forehead, and yoongi whips his head to the side in shock.
taehyung has his jaw clenched tight in pain.
he raises the pistol in his hand once again to fire a few more shots in quick succession and grits his teeth to brace for the recoil that follows each time.
the gunshots have the thick mob of infected falling away from the doors long enough for the elevator to close shut this time.
yoongi leaps forward to press the button for the nineteenth floor and has to grab onto the railing on his right to keep himself from falling forward when the elevator suddenly jerks forward in a jarring motion and starts to climb up the shaft.
but there is no time for relief to flood his lungs, because not a moment later, yoongi hears the thunk of a skull meeting the hard metallic surface of the wall.
taehyung hisses, and the gun is dropped on the floor with a loud clatter.
yoongi curses as he twists around and drops to his knees before taehyung.
taehyung is cupping his injured arm that had to bear the brunt of the recoil.
blood drips from the gaps of his fingers, and yoongi sees the frantic flare and fall of his chest through his soaked shirt stuck to every inch of him.
gently, yoongi moves taehyung’s fingers away from the wound and pulls the fabric of his shirt taut before he starts to hack away the bloody sleeve with his knife.
taehyung sits with his head tipped back against the wall and his jaw clenched tight while yoongi works.
he’s silent save for the few hisses that escape his teeth, and yoongi knows that he could be gentler, but his hands are shaking and making his movements clumsier in their panic.
"what the fuck were you thinking?"
he hisses, supporting taehyung’s back off the wall with a palm as he reaches around his torso to unwind the sticky cloth from his body.
taehyung doesn’t answer him, and yoongi lets the wet scraps of his shirt fall on the floor.
his own hand is dripping with blood.
it’s drenched the sleeve of his jacket—soaked his entire arm—and there is something awfully unsettling about seeing so much of taehyung’s blood on himself.
taehyung slumps against the wall once again, and his eyes are squeezed shut in pain when yoongi finally lets himself assess the damage.
but he must hear the way yoongi’s heart screeches to a sharp stop because he opens his eyes slightly.
"do you get it now?"
taehyung asks him, voice strained and breathless.
yoongi’s eyes flit to taehyung’s face for a brief second before falling back to the bite on his bicep.
it is a frightful sight.
dark reds and violets are mangled and matted into deep indentations of teeth as wide as his own palm.
blood seeps out of it in streaks and slowly trickles down to collect at the tip of taehyung’s elbow, and yoongi feels his stomach churn.
he wants to throw up, but he keeps staring at it.
he can't look away even when he feels the tears rise to his eyes and blur his sight.
"i am infected, yoongi."
taehyung sounds unnervingly calm, and yoongi clenches his teeth tight as the urge to scream grows.
"we’re trying to contain the infected to the lower floors, and you’re giving one a free ride all the way to the top."
there is a panic thundering between his temples, so hard that his head throbs, and yoongi has yet to take his eyes off the horrifying cluster of blue veins that spreads out from the bite and extends all the way up to taehyung’s neck like roots.
the skin between the two arched rows of teeth is a sickly purple, and yoongi stares at the way taehyung’s lower lip trembles, the way his chest seems to stutter and fight for a breath.
"shut up," he hisses through his gritted teeth, the tears creeping back, and yoongi hates himself for it.
the air between them is tense, and yoongi can feel taehyung’s eyes on him but he's too scared to look up.
instead, he swallows down the lump in his throat harshly and twists around to check the number of floors left to climb.
seven, the glowing numbers above the car’s control panel say.
twelve more floors, yoongi thinks as he stares at the numbers and waits for the eight to follow.
it doesn’t.
instead, all of a sudden, the lift jerks forward with a violent jolt.
yoongi throws his hands out to brace the wall on either side of taehyung’s head, shielding taehyung’s body with his own just as there is a loud piercing screech and the elevator car comes to an abrupt halt.
the lights go out, and yoongi’s stomach drops, the knife in his hand falling and clattering against the floor.
"fuck!"
he screams and scrambles off the floor, but he can hardly see a thing in his panic, much less in the dark.
yoongi slips on the blood that's been seeping out from the corpse and flooding the car, and he has just enough time to get his elbows between him and the floor before the collision can crush his nose and knock his teeth down his throat.
a scream catches in his throat when he finds himself inches from the dead woman's face, staring straight into her bloodshot eyes.
and for a moment, yoongi freezes.
terror strikes down his spine, then slowly coils itself around the length of it.
there's something truly horrifying about staring death in the eye; like if you dare to blink, it'll have you too.
and the stench of blood and decayed flesh crawls into his lungs as if it's teasing him with a taste of his own approaching fate, but yoongi grits his teeth and pushes himself off the floor on tender knees.
he fumbles in the dark for the wall and carefully steps over the corpse as he tries to reach the control panel.
when he finds the flip he’s been searching for, yoongi flicks it up and the emergency lights come on, coating the car with their dim white glow.
the elevator has stopped between the seventh and the eighth floor; and like a possessed man, yoongi jams his finger into the button for the nineteenth floor again and again.
but nothing happens.
the lift remains heavy and stagnant.
"they must’ve cut the power to contain the outbreak," taehyung says.
yoongi whips around to look at him, but taehyung doesn't sound surprised.
he doesn't even seem particularly distressed.
he looks resigned, and yoongi doesn't want to think about what that means.
he twists back around to press the emergency call button even if part of him already knows that it's hopeless.
a loud ring echoes in the elevator.
nobody picks up—obviously—because who the fuck would be manning the phone desk in the middle of an outbreak.
the ringing continues before it eventually dies out, and the silence that follows it cements up to their throats.
the lift remains unmoving even after he's pressed every possible button on the panel.
but yoongi doesn't turn around.
he slams his forehead against the wall and squeezes his eyes shut as hard as he can.
holds back the furious tears that threaten to escape.
in the quiet, everything feels awfully still.
and it doesn't take long for yoongi to recognise it for what it is: the calm before a storm.
the air hangs heavy, and there’s an unfamiliar fear crawling up the back of his neck.
yoongi holds his breath even though he doesn't know what he's bracing for.
all he knows is that there is something coming, and that whatever it is—it isn’t good.
"yoongi."
taehyung's voice is soft, and his breathing is hard.
it has yoongi's chest clenching into itself, but he doesn't look at him.
there is a chill climbing up his spine, a knowing kind of foreboding.
"i spared a shot from before.
you know—just in case," taehyung says, stilted and jerky.
yoongi turns around slowly, stiff with dread.
there is no wind, everything deadly silent.
and yoongi’s entire body is drawn tight, bracing for what’s to come.
taehyung is shrunken in towards the far end of the lift, knees curled and pressed to his chest to keep himself warm.
yoongi watches his ribcage shrink down as he breathes.
he’s so pale, so so pale; and he’s bleeding and shivering and— smiling.
taehyung is smiling at yoongi, lips blue and bloodless.
yoongi feels his throat grow impossibly tight.
taehyung reaches forward with a shaky hand, the pistol clasped in his fingers for yoongi to take.
"i’d do it myself but."
taehyung lowers his head to look down at his hands, and yoongi follows his gaze.
they are trembling.
violently.
"they wouldn’t stop shaking," taehyung breathes out; half a laugh, half choked up with something thick and wet.
and yoongi squeezes his eyes shut.
this time he doesn't bother holding the tears.
they drip down his cheeks helplessly, his lungs clenching tight like somebody wrung them dry, and he wants nothing more than to sink to his knees and retch.
yoongi considers wrenching the doors open and climbing their way out of the lift, but if the strain alone won’t kill taehyung, the swarm of infected waiting for them outside most definitely will.
pressing down on his eyes hard enough to hurt, yoongi forces himself to think, and he doesn't think of the infected.
he doesn't think of the wicked, gaping bite that sits on taehyung's bicep, or how his blood has soaked yoongi's clothes wet.
he doesn't think about their failed marriage or the dead woman staring back at him with haunted hollow eyes.
he doesn't think of the antidote that might not even work, or that one savoury bullet sitting in taehyung's pistol.
he thinks, instead, about the blue blooming on taehyung's lips and the way his body wouldn't stop shivering.
the way the loss of blood would get to him before any virus can.
"shut up," yoongi whispers quietly.
"do me a favor, and just—shut up."
"we don’t have long," taehyung starts, voice tightening how it always does when he’s about to say something that he knows yoongi won’t like.
"yoongi—" "no."
yoongi’s eyes fly open and he jerks his chin down to meet taehyung’s eyes, suddenly furious.
his fists shake where he’s clenched them tight by his sides.
"i don’t care."
and he doesn't let taehyung speak, wasting no time as he steps over the dead body and drops down to his knees before taehyung to snatch the pistol out of his hands.
"i don’t care," yoongi hisses again, his face inches from taehyung’s and his voice wet with something he isn't ready to name yet.
"i’m not going to fucking kill you, taehyung, what the fuck."
taehyung doesn't answer him, and yoongi tucks away the pistol in the waistband of his jeans before he strips off his blood-soaked jacket.
"what are you doing?"
taehyung asks him when yoongi starts to pull his shirt over his head as well.
he makes quick work of it, not caring if his cuts are neat or not.
a large portion of the shirt is drenched in blood, and he carefully chops those bits away with his knife until he's left with a long sizeable strip of clean cotton.
taehyung watches him warily as yoongi reaches forward to wind the cloth around his bicep and above the bite.
coiling the fabric around taehyung’s bicep and the curve of his shoulder in two overlapping turns, yoongi brings the ends together and pulls them tight before tying them into a knot.
"pass me the knife," he says and holds his palm out without looking away.
taehyung must've caught on because he hands him the metal without a word.
"it won’t stop it completely," yoongi mutters as he secures the knife to the knot in an attempt at an improvised tourniquet.
"but it should buy us some time."
the tourniquet will block both the arterial and lymphatic flow, stopping the bleeding and slowing the spread of the virus.
but, realistically, even the best possible outcome would result in taehyung losing an arm.
yoongi twists the knife to tighten the bandage and catches taehyung's face contorting in pain.
"i'm sorry."
yoongi bites his lip as he twists the makeshift windlass one more time and sees the veins in taehyung’s temples jut out with how hard he’s clenching his jaw.
"it's…fine," taehyung rasps and lets his head fall back against the wall with a quiet thud.
holding the knife in its place, yoongi grabs one of the leftover scraps of cloth, long and thin enough for yoongi to tie around the hilt of the knife and fasten it to taehyung's arm to keep it from unspinning and loosening the tourniquet.
"don't move your arm," yoongi instructs but then softens his voice.
"it's—i'm sorry, it's the best i can do right now."
losing an arm is a lot better than the other option.
"it's fine," taehyung repeats.
his breaths are strained, and he's squeezed his eyes shut again.
"thank you."
yoongi drops his hands, and for a long moment he wonders if this is where they break.
alone, confined in a tiny box, blood squelching under their boots and a dead woman watching them with her neck twisted all the way to the side.
yoongi forces his eyes closed.
he feels too unhinged, too jittery.
and his entire body threatens to collapse under him as he crawls back to the other end of the car and slumps against the wall across taehyung.
taehyung may say that he’s okay, but yoongi isn’t.
the elevator is dead silent, and for a long time, yoongi sits there slowly breathing in; then breathing out.
everything feels uneasy.
too still.
and yoongi closes his eyes and wraps his arms around his knees to keep himself from shivering.
he feels unsettled, somewhere inside him that he hadn't felt before.
the elevator is too still.
ominous.
like if he dares to lean too hard against the wall, it will tip over and go hurtling down to their deaths.
yoongi bites down on his lip and presses his face into his arms until he can’t breathe.
he’s never liked the dark, but he’s so scared.
scared that if he opens his eyes, he’ll see taehyung slumped against the wall with a bullet sunk into his forehead like a third eye.
yoongi bites hard on his tongue, and squeezes his eyes shut as hard as he can.
he wants to throw up, but he remains frozen against the wall, arms growing numb from how hard he's hugging his knees.
he doesn’t know what he’s waiting for, but it doesn’t come.
the pistol stays on his hip, heavy and foreboding, and it’s the sound of taehyung's quiet voice that snaps him out of it.
"yoongi," taehyung says, an awful scratch from his throat.
yoongi lifts his head to see taehyung watching him with a dazed look in his eyes.
as if he isn't looking at yoongi at all.
it shouldn't terrify him as much as it does.
"what do you reckon a man from the upper paleolithic would be like?"
taehyung says all of a sudden, so abruptly that yoongi blinks at him in surprise.
"what?"
he croaks out and pushes his palms against the floor to sit straighter.
the question is so far removed from everything yoongi's been peeling and picking apart in his own head.
something briefly flickers across taehyung’s face, too minute for yoongi to pick apart, and his eyes slide back to yoongi’s.
"if say—a man from the late upper paleolithic survived until the present day," taehyung says slowly, his gaze heavy.
"what do you think he’d be like?"
taehyung's eyes are clearer now under the sweat damp hair matted to his forehead.
the question makes no more sense than it did the previous time, but taehyung tips his head to the side as he waits for yoongi to reply.
yoongi blinks a few more times as he processes taehyung's query and attempts to gather his thoughts.
something is not right, he is sure of that.
something is wrong, something is so, so wrong but yoongi can’t tell what the cause is.
"survived—what, like he never died?"
he clarifies, and taehyung nods.
"never aged?"
taehyung nods again, stiffly, like the action strains him.
"yes.
what would he be like?"
there’s an odd inflection in his voice, a forced flatness, like he’s trying very hard to keep it from breaking.
and it is not an unfamiliar situation; it is a game the two of them played often in the past.
they threw absurd premises at each other and then attempted to draw some amount of sense from them as they argued.
but then why does yoongi feel like something's not right here?
from the corner of his eye, he sees taehyung give him a strained smile.
and even though something in the air isn't right—a dampness that seems to stick to yoongi’s skin and sink deep into his bones like a warning: don’t talk of the undead, it says—it still is infinitely better than the image of yoongi burning a hole in taehyung’s skull, so he tips his head back against the wall and decides to play along with taehyung’s absurd hypotheticals despite everything in his body warning him not to.
"i suppose he’d be pretty damn tired," he drawls, and taehyung laughs.
it's a dry, brittle thing.
it makes yoongi’s skin crawl.
"but, seriously," yoongi continues once he's gotten past his initial surprise.
"i imagine that he might be like any of us."
taehyung makes a vague sound to prompt him to elucidate, and yoongi parts his knees to look at him.
"there is no anatomical difference between humans 14,000 years ago and the modern sapien today," he says, but then he clicks his tongue in afterthought.
"except we’ve grown taller."
taehyung’s lips pull at a corner in an amused smirk.
"have we all?"
he teases as he looks up and down yoongi’s body pointedly, and then cranes his neck in exaggeration as if yoongi might be hiding another few inches of his legs somewhere else in the elevator.
yoongi rolls his eyes at the expected dig and fights down the brief smile that tugs at the corners of his lips.
the joke is a sore one for sure, but the familiarity of it eases the tension between them a little.
at least taehyung’s able to joke like this.
"you’re not funny," he tells him, voice flat, and taehyung grins.
"natural selection picked taller humans who could see better in the tall grass of the savannahs," yoongi continues.
"actually, tall and skinny since a higher ratio of surface area to volume radiates heat more effectively in warmer climates.
your human would've lived through what—140 centuries?"
"roughly, yes."
"i mean, assuming normal intelligence, we believe men from the upper paleolithic were as intelligent as we are.
they just didn’t know as much.
but your man would’ve learned as the race learnt."
taehyung purses his lips and nods in thought.
there’s an odd look on his face.
his eyebrows pinch together, and he cuts his eyes back to yoongi again.
"and what do you suppose would’ve kept him alive?"
yoongi lifts an eyebrow at him.
"aren’t you supposed to be the biologist?"
he asks, but taehyung makes an impatient flapping gesture with his hand as if to say just answer.
"fine."
yoongi rolls his eyes for a second time.
"in science fiction speak, i'd say…" he thinks for a moment before cocking his head to the side in question, "perfect regeneration of the body’s cells by the circulating mesenchymal stem cells originating in the bone marrow?"
"the pancreas turns over cells every twenty four hours," taehyung agrees.
"the stomach lining in three days, and the whole body in seven years.
but typically, with time, the process falters.
waste accumulates and eventually proves fatal to function."
"so if a quirk in his immune system led to a perfect detox, ergo perfect renewal?"
"then yeah," taehyung licks his lips, "he could, in a way, dodge decay."
yoongi laughs at that.
"now wouldn’t i kill to have that secret."
"would you really?"
taehyung asks him, lips pressing into a straight fine line.
forced, yoongi thinks.
"if i stayed healthy and didn’t die, then why not?"
he shrugs.
"what a chance to learn.
who knows, we might even find a cure for the virus through it."
taehyung shoots him a rueful smile, but yoongi is picking apart possibilities in his head as he grows more invested in whatever absurdity taehyung has tossed at him.
"you know, the more i think about it...it’s not completely infeasible," yoongi muses, pushing himself off the wall and leaning forward on his knees.
"after all, anything is possible, right?
we’re literally living through a zombie apocalypse.
and one century’s magic is another century’s science.
everybody thought columbus was certifiable."
taehyung doesn’t respond immediately, and yoongi creases his eyebrows.
there’s something downright unnerving about the way taehyung watches him.
something in his face is changing, but yoongi doesn’t know what, and it terrifies him.
he is so dreadfully still that for one sickening moment, yoongi is afraid he's going into shock.
but then taehyung blinks back into focus and smiles.
and suddenly, sharply, yoongi knows that something’s not right.
"i had a chance to sail with him," taehyung says, and yoongi blinks in surprise at the sudden statement.
"by then i had a fair suspicion that the earth was round, but the fear still lingered, you know?
that we might drop off the edge at some point."
taehyung is still smiling, a taut pull of his pale lips, almost like he’s bracing for something.
yoongi stares back at taehyung’s face and hopes that it conveys the loss he’s feeling.
"i suppose you’re joking," he says slowly, and he watches taehyung carefully.
but taehyung doesn't reply.
his smile tightens just a little, like he’s wincing.
"i don’t get it."
taehyung breaks his gaze and stares at his lap where he’s wringing his fingers anxiously.
yoongi stupidly thinks about holding them in his own, but he’s too afraid to move.
"there’s nothing to get," taehyung says a few seconds later, so softly that yoongi has to strain to hear it.
"what are we talking about?"
yoongi’s voice shakes with uncertainty.
"we were just considering a caveman surviving up until the present time, were we not?"
taehyung has that awful expression on his face.
like he’s desperate not to say it.
"every ten years or so, when people start to notice that i don’t age, i leave everything and everybody behind me and move on."
taehyung doesn't meet his eyes, and something in yoongi’s chest suddenly seizes.
he feels a violent urge to surge forward and yank taehyung’s head up by his hair and ask him just what in the fresh hell is that supposed to mean.
it's a bad joke, and a very low one, even for taehyung.
but before he can get a word in, taehyung is speaking again.
"in what i call my first lifetime, i aged till about thirty two years.
what you see here."
he makes a gesture with his finger to point at his body.
he’s still not looking at yoongi, and it shouldn’t frighten him so much.
"i led my group, and they called me magical.
but gradually, the fear grew and they chased me away.
they thought that i was stealing their lives to stay young."
"the prehistoric origin of the vampire myth," yoongi croaks out in disbelief as he stares at taehyung with wide incredulous eyes.
"the first thousand years, i didn’t know up from sideways," taehyung continues, and yoongi is baffled.
taehyung is serious; he can see that now, but yoongi’s hands are starting to shake with how unhinged he feels.
"how do you know the first thousand years?"
he cuts taehyung off and clenches his fingers into fists, grabbing onto the first thing he can think of.
taehyung finally looks up at him, but his face is impassive, unreadable in a way that yoongi’s never seen before.
and an old ache flares up in yoongi’s chest again because there was a time when he had each one of his expressions and his emotions memorised, could tell them apart with his eyes closed and just a finger tracing the shape of his lips.
"an informed guess based on what i recall from my memory," taehyung answers him, and this time yoongi can’t help the incredulous snort that leaves him.
"most people can scarcely remember their childhood."
he lifts an eyebrow in challenge.
"and you’re saying that you remember what happened to you fourteen thousand years ago?"
but taehyung doesn’t seem affected by yoongi’s scathing skepticism.
he looks as though he’d expected it.
"like yours, my memory is selective too," he counters.
"i remember the high points, the low points, the traumas."
yoongi doesn’t answer; he couldn’t respond even if he tried.
and taehyung takes his silence as permission to keep speaking which—yoongi supposes it is.
"i kept getting chased away because i didn’t age, and eventually i got the hang of moving on periodically," taehyung tells him, and yoongi likes to think that he’s got a good grasp of studying taehyung’s face to make out what he’s thinking, but right now yoongi can’t tell if the flat press of his lips or the slight dip of his eyebrows is grim or guarded or something else entirely.
and it terrifies him.
it terrifies him because yoongi feels as if he can no longer tell if the man before him is the very one he’d been married to for five years.
"the first two millennia were cold, and i learned that it was warmer at lower elevations—the late glacial period, i presume.
i remember seeing the british isles from what is now the french coast," taehyung continues, and he is no longer looking at yoongi.
he stares past yoongi’s shoulder as he speaks, as if lost in the visions of his recollection.
"huge mountains...on the other side of a deep valley that was shadowed by the setting sun.
this is before they got separated from the continent by rising seas as the glaciers melted."
"the end of the pleistocene epoch—it fits."
"yes—" taehyung starts.
"—into any textbook," yoongi snaps.
"and that’s where i found it!"
taehyung’s voice starts to rise now, eyes not moving from yoongi’s face.
"how could i have knowledgeable recall when i didn’t have knowledge?
all i can do is integrate my memories with modern findings."
and yoongi—he doesn’t know what to think.
he stares at taehyung, completely at a loss for words.
taehyung wouldn’t drag on an argument as absurd as this for so long; but what he’s saying offends common sense, and yoongi wants to believe him, he really does, but he—he can’t.
"we—we are not talking about reincarnations, are we?"
yoongi asks him a little desperately, mind reeling with possibilities.
"you’re not saying that you hold memories from previous lifetimes."
"no."
taehyung slumps his head against the wall in resignation.
"one lifetime."
"what about oceans?"
"didn’t see them until much later."
yoongi furrows his eyebrows.
"how would you be able to tell an ocean from a lake?"
"big waves—again i can only be cognizant of it in retrospect."
taehyung smiles at him.
even though he’s making some amount of sense, that doesn’t make it any less absurd.
and it’s hard to speak in the thick silence that follows.
yoongi can’t tell if it’s the result of the unease that’s crawled under all of his skin or the dry discomfort in his throat when he tries to swallow.
taehyung’s smile wanes; he’s looking all over yoongi’s face for something.
but yoongi feels too unhinged, too unbalanced.
he’s just barely holding himself together as it is, and if there’s one thing he’s sure of, it’s that he’s going to lose his goddamn mind before he even begins to consider the implications of whatever it is that taehyung is trying to convince him of.
instead, he chooses to close his eyes and slant his head up against the wall quietly.
he wants to curl up, but his bones are jammed stiff.
rigid in their refusal.
the quiet doesn’t last because just a moment later, yoongi is abruptly struck by an inane memory.
"that van gogh," he blurts out loudly before his eyes fly open and he shoots back up again, "the one you said was a fake, but you were so stubborn about hanging it in the living room anyway."
taehyung blinks at him for a moment, taken aback by his sudden outburst, but then he's breaking into a grin in no time.
"he gifted it to me," he says.
"of course."
yoongi rolls his eyes now.
a smile tugs at his own lips but he fights it down.
"i went by the name vante at the time," taehyung admits, and then adds a little bashfully, "i was uh—a pig farmer."
"a pig farmer?"
yoongi can’t hold his laugh this time, incredulous and impossibly endeared at the same time.
he can even picture it: taehyung in boots, overalls and a straw hat, giving little piglets fond rubs.
the image is so remarkably vivid because that sounds just like him.
"yeah.
he would come to my place and paint.
we talked a lot about capturing nature in art."
taehyung is smiling; yoongi notices that for the first time, it’s genuine.
and the sight has a sharp stab of pain shooting up his chest, like nails peeling off a scab that never truly healed.
and yoongi knows what a terrible idea it is, has known it ever since hoseok introduced taehyung as the newest addition to their research team three months ago, one year into the pandemic and eighteen months since yoongi and taehyung’s nasty separation.
it is a terrible idea.
but trapped in an elevator till help gets to them before the virus reaches taehyung's brain or yoongi shoots him dead, there truly isn’t a lot to lose.
and it’s not that he believes taehyung; that’s too much.
but yoongi can no longer deny that he’s missed this.
talking to taehyung, arguing with him, laughing, and just talking after almost two years of radio silence.
taehyung is probably right.
they don’t have long anyway, and all of a sudden, yoongi can’t bring himself to care at all.
"did you ever do any?"
he asks him abruptly after a minute of neither of them saying a word.
"art, i mean.
cave art?"
taehyung’s surprise shows on his face, but he must realise yoongi’s attempts at reconciliation because his face loses its tension.
he smiles at him for a moment before he replies.
"no, not cave art, not at that time.
but there was this guy—" taehyung frowns as he struggles to remember, eyes flicking between yoongi’s face and something off to the side.
"i can’t recall his name, but he’d draw the animals we wished to eat.
but one evening, after an unsuccessful hunt, our chief stomped his teeth out because his magic had failed us.
after that someone else had to chew his food for him, and he got—i suspect—an infected jaw.
we had to dispose of him shortly after that."
"that’s..."
yoongi grimaces.
taehyung gives him a tight-lipped smile.
"you have to know what to kill," he says, and there is grim humor in his words.
but yoongi doesn’t miss the weight of them, and his mouth dries instantly.
his eyes dart to taehyung’s bloody arm where the mass of blue veins has creeped up his shoulder to his neck.
the longer yoongi stares at it, the more it seems as if a horrid parasite is feeding off taehyung’s blood and slowly climbing up the column of his throat to reach the big prize: his brain.
the pistol tucked into yoongi’s jeans suddenly starts to feel frighteningly heavy, but he forcibly tears himself away from the thought.
"who else were you?"
he asks once he blinks back into focus to meet taehyung’s eyes.
"i lived as a merchant for a long time," taehyung starts slowly, probably working out how to piece together thousands of years in a singular telling.
"i’d grown curious about the world, and it was around the beginning of the bronze age.
i followed trade routes from the east.
copper.
tin.
i learnt languages and medicine as i went.
everywhere i travelled, there were all these new and different creation myths, so many gods, and after a while…well i figured it was all…" he makes a vague dismissive gesture with his hand.
"i was sumerian for 2,000 years, then babylonian under hammurabi.
but moving on was easier as a hunter-gatherer.
it became difficult when villages emerged, and tougher still when authority was centralised."
"do you remember where you came from?"
yoongi asks him, crossing his legs when one of them starts to prickle with pins and needles.
"geography hasn’t changed all that much."
instead of answering him, taehyung throws out a question of his own.
"where did you live when you were four years old?"
yoongi frowns.
"with my parents at their farm just outside of daegu," he says because taehyung knows that already.
"your mother—she took you to the market?
what direction was it from your house?"
"i don’t know."
"are there any references that stuck with you?"
yoongi struggles to recall them, thinking back to his hand in his mother’s as they walked along the streets, and the shop owners who stopped them to coo and pinch his cheeks.
"there was a gas station and...an old schoolhouse?"
he cocks his head to the side, not sure if that is a reliable memory.
"and if you went back there, would it still be the same?"
taehyng asks him.
yoongi presses his lips together.
he had gone back there, frightened out of his mind when the pandemic broke out.
"no, it’s all built up now," he answers.
"hence the saying—you can’t go back home again."
taehyung tips his head back against the wall as he watches him.
his breathing is more haggard now, chest shuddering with every breath of air he fights for.
"because it’s not there anymore.
now imagine it on my scale: i migrated across an endless vast earth full of endless new things—forests, deserts, mountains, tundra, canyons.
it was just my solitary viewpoint of a world i knew nothing about.
even if i were to try and recall it, everything is built up beyond recognition now."
yoongi props up a knee to lean his weight on it.
"fascinating," he says as he watches taehyung.
"an answer for every question."
taehyung matches his stare, and for a long moment they simply watch each other in silence, neither of them looking away.
but then yoongi closes his eyes and laughs.
there’s no humor in it, and when he pulls them open, he stares straight at taehyung.
his smile fades.
"except one.
taehyung, why are you doing this?"
the air goes still as soon as he says it.
"yoongi..."
taehyung starts lowly, and it doesn’t sound like an answer.
if anything, it sounds like a warning.
and yoongi knows it—he fucking knows it.
everything about the entire conversation has felt awfully concluding, and yoongi fucking knows it.
they don’t have long left, and from the corner of his eye, he can see the way the woman’s mouth hangs open, the way her eyes stretch wide in horror.
the entire floor is coated with a thick layer of her blood, and the stench of it has settled in yoongi’s lungs permanently.
it’s all he’s been breathing in.
for the first time, yoongi feels so unbearably helpless.
"i..."
taehyung finally sighs, and he still has that pinched look on his face, pained and reluctant to speak.
"i thought—maybe this wasn’t a good idea, but i wanted—" taehyung closes his eyes, and his face twists like he’s going to be sick.
"what?"
yoongi spits impatiently.
there’s a panic clogging his throat, and his hands tremble in his lap.
when taehyung opens his eyes, he’s carefully schooled his face into that awful impassiveness.
he stares right at yoongi, pinning him to his spot.
"i wanted to say goodbye," he says.
"as myself for once."
his voice is soft, but yoongi feels the weight of his words like he'd yelled them in his face.
taehyung falls silent like he’s waiting for yoongi to spit something scathing back at him, but yoongi’s throat is closing in painfully tight painfully quickly.
"n-no," he stammers out.
"yoongi—" taehyung starts.
"no," yoongi nearly screams, and taehyung goes quiet.
yoongi wants to glare at him but he doesn’t.
he closes his eyes and presses on them hard enough till his head hurts, and then some more.
"i—you have to know how you sound," he stutters out, swallowing down the growing hysteria in his throat.
the whole thing just feels like a horrible disorienting nightmare that never seems to end.
"you can’t seriously ask me to believe you.
you can’t tell me to erase everything i’ve known and believe you when you say that you're some fourteen millennia old caveman—what the fuck."
yoongi’s voice is shrill.
he hides his face in his palms and slouches forward on his knees.
"i don’t understand," he whispers weakly.
he wants to rub his face again, but he’s done it too many times and it hurts.
it hurts everywhere.
"yoongi, look," taehyung starts slowly, his voice cutting through yoongi’s panic.
yoongi peels his hands away from his face only to be met with taehyung’s unreadable face.
"there’s absolutely no way in this whole world for me to prove it to you.
just like there’s no way for you to disprove it."
taehyung’s gaze is intense and hard to return.
and yoongi grits his teeth at the unfairness of it all.
"being unable to disprove a claim only makes it theoretically possible, not true," he hisses through his teeth.
"i shouldn't have to disprove every absurd fictional entity out there to justify my disbelief in their existence."
"look.
you have two simple choices.
you can either get all bent out of shape trying to argue and bench-press logic."
taehyung pauses for emphasis.
"or, we can just talk."
yoongi sets his jaw tight.
he knows what he wants, obviously, but there is a helpless heat collecting behind his eyelids.
his hand flits towards his eyes but he aborts the movement halfway, settling for blinking back the tears instead.
"fine," he says thickly, and taehyung parts his lips to speak but yoongi cuts him off.
"we can talk, and i can listen critically.
but you can’t ask me to believe you.
not now, not when you had eight years to do whatever the fuck it is that you’re doing now."
he wants to sound sharper, more vicious, but he can’t put any volume into his voice.
he’s so damn exhausted, and it’s taking all of his control to not fall forward and cry.
"that’s fair," taehyung says, equally as soft.
nothing about this is fair, yoongi wants to yell at him, but he bites back the snappish reply, rubbing at his eyes instead as he thinks of another way to pick apart taehyung’s ridiculous claim.
"so, you’re a...caveman," he starts slowly, tipping his head back to stare at the ceiling when it becomes clear that the tears have no intention of going.
"and in this enormous lifetime, you’ve never been ill?"
"i have.
just about as much as anyone."
yoongi jerks his head down to look at taehyung in surprise.
"of what?"
"in prehistory, i couldn’t tell you.
but in the last few hundred years, i’ve gotten over typhoid, yellow fever, smallpox.
i’ve survived the black plague."
yoongi’s eyes dart down to taehyung’s bare chest before flitting back to his face.
"bubonic?"
he asks disbelievingly.
"and you’re not scarred?"
taehyung bites his lip like he does each time he’s scared of saying something.
he doesn’t meet his eyes, only presses his lips into a fine line, and yoongi grits his teeth.
"what is it?"
he snaps as he watches taehyung swallow hard.
"i don’t scar," taehyung admits finally, and his eyes flicker up tentatively as if to gauge yoongi’s reaction.
and he must see the look on his face because he cuts in before yoongi can begin.
"please, i know you don’t believe me," taehyung says quickly, a frantic edge slipping into his voice.
"i shouldn’t have expected you to either.
but the least you can do is take it at face value and explore it from there?
if i don’t scar, is it really any stranger than the rest of it?"
yoongi’s hands tremble where they’re fisted tightly into the fabric of his jeans, and he has to swallow back that violent urge to scream, to cry, to grab taehyung by the shoulders and shake him, ask him what kind of a sick joke he’s playing.
if his plan is to drive yoongi completely insane in this little time they have, then it’s working.
"you don’t scar, you don’t age, and yet—" he hacks out a strangled sound, something between a laugh and a sob, and drags his eyes to the blue veins once again.
they’ve reached his ear.
"are you scared of dying, taehyung?"
yoongi asks him.
taehyung’s face falters, turns into a grimace.
"who isn’t?"
he asks.
"and how did the primitive man regard death?"
"we had a practical concept.
we fell down, didn’t get up, started to smell bad and came apart.
we understood injuries, but infections—those were mysterious.
and aging, the biggest mystery of all."
"you realized that you were different."
taehyung nods quietly.
"not immediately," he adds.
"it was difficult to synthesize my experience into a view of myself.
at first, i thought everyone else had something wrong with them.
they were the ones who grew old and died.
animals too."
"but not you."
it’s not a question.
"but not me," taehyung agrees.
he isn’t smiling, but some resentful part of yoongi wishes that he would.
maybe then yoongi could justify the awful pressure in his chest.
like something is squeezing his lungs and wringing them tight.
taehyung is silent for a long time, and yoongi thinks about the first time they met—which by some awful irony happened in an elevator too.
yoongi had spilled his coffee on taehyung’s expensive shirt in his rush to get to his classroom, but taehyung had chuckled and waved off his frantic apologies, asking yoongi if he would let him take him out to dinner as payment instead.
and so they’d gotten dinner together, and ever since—yoongi couldn’t get enough of taehyung’s smiles, his giggles and his loud unabashed laughter.
couldn’t get enough of tasting them against his lips and feeling them against the back of his neck in the mornings.
he’d wanted to touch taehyung.
to yank him down by his stupid tie and kiss him.
to take him home and fall in bed with him, but he'd gone and fallen in love with him instead—the kind you don’t really ever return from.
and he really shouldn’t be thinking about this, yoongi knows that.
the uneasy peace that has settled between them feels too delicate to break.
but yoongi can feel the words on the tip of his tongue, just waiting to spill out.
he shouldn’t; his gut twists tight at the thought, and he sits in silence as he stares at the wall above taehyung’s head.
everything feels so still.
just the two of them trapped inside these four walls while the world around them crumbles apart.
it would sound poetic if yoongi didn’t feel so crushingly helpless.
and maybe it’s that, or maybe it is the stench of death that hangs low and thick in the air.
maybe it’s the lifeless woman in the corner of his vision, or the frightening weight on his hip.
or maybe it’s something that has been building for a long time now, longer than yoongi wants to admit.
but he knows that if he doesn’t do this now, it will drive him insane.
assuming that it hasn’t already done that.
"as you grow older, the days and weeks and months pass quicker," he starts before he can stop himself, and his heart races in his chest.
his whole body is drawn tight as he tries to keep himself in control.
taehyung’s gaze shifts to him, but yoongi doesn’t meet his eyes.
there’s a dreadful awareness growing under his skin, and it makes his hands shake violently.
he clenches them tight in his lap, thankful that taehyung can’t see them because yoongi knows that this is it—this is the point of no return.
"what does a day or a year mean to you?
or what would...what would five years mean to you?"
his voice catches towards the end, and for a moment, everything goes horribly still.
i love you, taehyung had said to him, laughed it in his ear actually.
they were both drunk on wine and stumbling down the night street lit up by christmas lights.
i love you, more than i know what to do with.
yoongi’s throat aches.
"yoongi—" taehyung starts, his voice dipped low in warning.
"what would a marriage of five years mean to someone like you?"
yoongi cuts him off before he can continue.
something still stings when he says it, but yoongi can’t tell who the words hurt more.
he hears taehyung swallow and thinks that he’s going to speak.
but there’s nothing.
there’s fucking nothing.
yoongi laughs even though he feels like screaming.
"nothing, huh?"
and he hates the way his voice grows thick with tears.
he feels so fucking stupid.
taehyung doesn’t respond.
when yoongi finally looks at him, he has that awful pinched look on his face, like he’s both desperate and terrified to tell.
and a blinding anger comes rushing to him all at once.
yoongi clenches his teeth hard enough that he thinks he’ll crush them.
"did i mean anything to you at all?"
he spits out, blind and suddenly too angry to stop his voice from shaking.
he sees taehyung flinch and part his lips, but yoongi cuts him off just as quickly.
"actually, no, don’t answer that.
you said that you realised you were different from the rest of humanity.
do you see yourself as someone superior to the rest of us?"
"i didn’t mean it like that—" taehyung stresses, and he truly looks anguished.
but it’s not that yoongi doesn’t believe him.
the fact of the matter is: yoongi doesn’t even know who taehyung is anymore.
"would you have come to my funeral, taehyung?"
yoongi asks him and it’s hard not to enjoy the way taehyung recoils.
yoongi, in some twisted way, wants to see him cry.
"would you have felt some kind of guilt?
or do you just not feel shit anymore?"
he ploughs on despite the way taehyung’s face seems to be crumbling with anguish.
the rational part of him is gone, and yoongi is too angry to care.
"we would die, and you would live.
but would such a thing be fair?
i’m only exploring what you said like you asked me to.
whether i believe it or not is of no importance."
"i—i don’t know about fair," taehyung stutters out, "but i didn’t wish to upset you.
this was obviously a bad idea.
but, yoongi, i care for you a lot.
i really do, and i—" yoongi ignores him.
"since you may not die, while we most assuredly will, there must be a reason for that, no?"
yoongi can hardly recognize his hollow voice, or the hand that trails down to his waist as he speaks.
and maybe taehyung doesn’t either because he falls silent as well.
"perhaps..."
yoongi’s fingers curl around the cool metal, and he drags his eyes up to taehyung’s face.
"what do you think, taehyung?"
he asks in the few frightful seconds before he raises his arm and reveals the prize in his hand.
taehyung stops moving all at once, frozen stiff in the face of the pistol.
"a shot to the leg?"
yoongi cocks his head to the side, a cruel twist to his lip as he taunts, "maybe we could watch it heal."
the elevator is grave and silent, and taehyung is so, so still.
"or..."
yoongi lifts his arm, shifting his aim higher.
"a bullet in the head?"
he asks, anger thinned to a threatening sweetness.
"what exactly will happen?"
the tension that has been weighing over them this entire time grows thicker, and yoongi feels it stick to his throat each time he breathes in.
taehyung slowly lifts his head to look at him, and yoongi grits his teeth.
he waits for taehyung to argue, to try and convince yoongi otherwise.
but taehyung doesn’t do that.
they both know that he won’t.
that he can’t.
for a long time, there’s nothing.
everything is deadly silent.
"okay," taehyung whispers finally, no fight at all.
and shrunken in against the wall with his eyes pressed shut, it feels as if he has been bracing for this moment from the very beginning.
have you ever thought about dying?
yoongi had asked him once.
they’d been stargazing, a rare retreat from university lectures and grading papers, and taehyung had laughed in response to his question, a surprised smile on his lips when he glanced at yoongi from the corner of his eye.
more than you can ever imagine, he’d said, and there was an odd weight to his voice that yoongi couldn’t place at the time.
are you afraid of it?
yoongi had asked him, interlacing their fingers together to find some semblance of familiarity because there were often times like this—moments when taehyung would seem so foreign and distant that yoongi felt as if they were talking about two entirely separate matters.
all things must come to an end.
taehyung had smiled, but it was forced, his lips stretched so tight they strained the corners of his mouth.
i may fear it, but i do not fight it.
taehyung had twisted around to face him then.
and in that one moment, yoongi could sense that there was something strange about him.
hidden between the lines of his face and the taut, tight pull of his lips.
something ancient and so, so eerie.
nothing lasts forever.
taehyung had leaned forward to seal yoongi’s lips shut before he could ask the meaning behind his morbid words.
like nothing should.
and yoongi feels so uncontrollably violent.
he tightens his grip on the pistol, but his arm won’t stop shaking.
he feels so fucking angry, but the anger isn’t from being lied to.
it’s not from the relentless arguments in the middle of the night, or the morning yoongi found the apartment empty save for the ring on the nightstand.
not from the two years of agonizing silence, or the sweltering desire to scream each time taehyung entered his line of vision in the past three months.
there are memories washing back to him, memories he’d sealed and buried deep under layers and layers of fury.
and yoongi feels angry—angry at himself for never doubting, for not caring enough when taehyung brushed off a question about his parents with a stiff they died a long time back, or when he never had any childhood photographs to show.
what he believed was him being sensitive, yoongi now feels like a fool.
his fingers have grown numb from how hard he’s holding the pistol, and just reaching for the trigger makes him nauseous.
memories that hadn’t felt important at the time, he feels them rising to the surface now, fusing together to form a deeply unsettling picture that he doesn’t want to think about.
and yoongi feels like he’s finally gone mad.
the ugly feeling growing roots between his ribs doesn’t die, and taehyung’s face doesn’t change.
bathed in blood and with blue veins creeping under his torso and climbing up his throat, taehyung looks like horror in human skin.
his hair is dark and his skin so pale.
he is taller than yoongi, but curled into himself like this he looks smaller than yoongi’s ever known.
and something inside yoongi is shaking, something that makes his ribs rattle against his chest each time he breathes.
he feels so hopelessly alone, and he knows that some things are better left unsaid, that perhaps he should let this die an unspoken death too.
maybe that would hurt less.
actually no, he decides and swallows hard.
he needs to know.
and there won’t be another chance to ask.
"did you ever love me?"
he asks, throat tightening painfully around the five words.
he sees taehyung open his eyes but doesn’t meet them.
he stares at the floor as his vision blurs.
"please be honest, you don’t—you don't have to care about sparing my feelings.
i just—" his voice cracks and he gasps as he tries to speak around the painful lump in his throat.
"i just really thought you did—and i know that there’s no use in talking about it now, but i—fuck."
yoongi shudders out a sob, gnashing his teeth till his eyes stop stinging even though the stone in his throat stays.
he’d known it two years ago when he ultimately slipped the ring off his finger.
he knew that he was going to be alone for the rest of his life, but this just feels needlessly cruel.
taehyung doesn’t respond for a long time, and the silence that follows is humiliating.
"say something," yoongi hisses, trying and failing to keep his voice from shaking.
his chest hurts as it heaves for air, and yoongi’s body sags forward helplessly, the pistol in his hand falling on the floor and making a loud metallic sound.
and still taehyung doesn’t speak.
yoongi curls into himself and wraps his arms around his knees as his body shakes with uncontrollable sobs.
"why didn’t you ever say something?"
he gasps out, quivering for breath.
"i’d have believed you.
i—" yoongi can’t speak past the betrayal tightening its fingers around his throat, so completely that breathing is impossible and yoongi’s left choking and trembling in its hold.
what he wants to say is, i didn’t want you to feel like you had to be somebody else for me.
what he really wants to say is, i thought you trusted me.
(i thought you loved me.) he can’t help but notice how it’s the silence that speaks the loudest, how it speaks the truth that yoongi hadn’t wanted to let himself think about.
and he bites down hard on his tongue and it hurts, hurts, hurts, but it doesn’t help.
yoongi feels trapped in his own head.
can’t stop crying for reasons he can’t speak.
all he can hear is taehyung’s whisper against his skin, an endless vengeful loop of marry me?
"yoongi–" taehyung says thickly, voice trapped low in his chest.
for as small as the elevator is, he sounds impossibly far away.
"come here please."
the cold is leaching into yoongi’s skin, seeping inside from his wet boots and the bare expanse of his curved back.
and yoongi no longer knows if he’s shaking from the tears or the cold.
he feels so numb, and lifting his head feels a little like giving up.
there are words crawling up to his mouth for yoongi to spit at taehyung with all the intent to hurt, but they die in his throat the moment he catches sight of him.
all at once, everything feels too real.
against the dim glow of the emergency lights, taehyung is engulfed in blue veins that spread all across his chest and gather up to his throat till they curl around the curve of his ear.
and yoongi nearly cries again at the sight of it, couldn’t stop the strangled noise that tears out of him even if he tried.
taehyung sits with his head against the wall as he watches the ceiling for no actual purpose other than to keep his tears from spilling down.
and for the longest time, yoongi watches the hunch of his shoulders, the erratic heaves of his chest, and the way taehyung shivers and braces himself and shivers again and it doesn’t stop.
they’re both crying, and for once, it feels almost cathartic.
yoongi slowly pushes himself off the floor.
everything in his body feels jittery and unsteady, and he stumbles a little as he walks to the wall across him, blood splashing under his boots before he twists around and drops down next to taehyung’s uninjured side.
taehyung doesn’t say anything, but his arm comes to curl around yoongi’s waist and pulls him closer.
yoongi stiffens at the unexpected action.
but then he rearranges himself so taehyung isn’t straining to reach him, and taehyung pulls him closer till he's pressed flush to his side.
and this close, yoongi can feel the rapid movement of taehyung’s chest.
he looks up at him and sees the mole on the slope of taehyung's nose, the one on his lower lip, sees how blue his lips are and how they quiver delicately.
yoongi’s heart clenches with familiar pain.
for a while, he just wants to forget.
forget that they are on death row, that the world is ending and that taehyung doesn’t love him.
just for some time, he wants to stop counting down the seconds, wants to close his eyes and just be.
before he can think to stop himself, yoongi is burying his face in taehyung’s neck and wrapping careful arms around his waist.
it is hardly a hug with yoongi twisted and half on his knees, his chin pressed into taehyung’s shoulders and his eyes squeezed shut, but yoongi feels the tension slowly leave the air.
even though it still aches somewhere in his chest, he feels like he can breathe easier now.
and yoongi doesn’t know how long they stay like that.
he tries not to focus on how taehyung’s shaking worsens; instead he presses his mouth to taehyung’s skin and allows himself to breathe, just for a bit.
taehyung smells of blood and the permanent stench of rot that has settled heavily in the air.
it should feel unpleasant, but yoongi doesn’t move because his skin is warm and only corpses grow cold, and taehyung is still warm, and yoongi’s heart grows so heavy, his ribs ache to hold it up.
there are so many things that he wants to say to him, so many things that he needs taehyung to know.
he can’t bear the thought of dying with them still crammed inside his chest, but he also knows how it’ll end and he’s not sure his heart can withstand hearing it again.
in the end, it’s taehyung who beats him to it.
"at first, i thought that there was something wrong with me," he starts shakily.
"m-maybe i was a bad guy for not dying."
yoongi pulls away a little to look at him.
the air is quiet and heavy, and when taehyung meets his eyes, yoongi sees the tears finally fall.
"after that, i began to wonder if i was cursed.
then i thought that perhaps i had a mission."
"do you still think you do?"
yoongi whispers.
taehyung is quiet for a long time, and when he speaks, his voice is both thick and quiet.
"i think—i think i just happened."
which, yoongi supposes, is as good an answer as any.
"is this also why your knowledge of history is so fucking insane?"
he asks him suddenly, a silly thing that strikes him out of nowhere.
it was a constant cause of banter between them because taehyung would often interrupt yoongi’s passionate rants with inane corrections that were of no actual historical significance to the subject matter but brought taehyung immense amusement because yoongi would start to argue about who was correct (which was, infuriatingly, almost always taehyung) but taehyung would simply interrupt him again with a kiss.
"no," taehyung laughs at the unexpected accusation and how much venom it’s spoken with, a quiet throaty thing that makes yoongi smile as well.
"that’s mostly based on study."
"with your mind—you must’ve studied a great deal."
"i have ten degrees.
including yours."
"thanks," yoongi drawls and pulls away from taehyung completely to shoot him an unamused look.
"that makes me feel a whole lot better."
taehyung laughs again, and it shoots a pang of loss in yoongi’s chest.
"i got my anthropology degree at columbia in 1890, so i'm a little behind the times.
the same with the other fields.
i can't keep up with the new stuff that comes along.
no one can, not even in their own specialty."
yoongi hums in thought as he leans back against the wall.
"i see.
no matter how long a person lives, they can't be ahead of their times.
they can't know more than what the best of the race knows.
when the world learned it was round, you learned it."
taehyung nods.
"it took some time.
news traveled slowly before communications were fancy.
there were social obstacles.
preconceptions.
screams from the churches."
"but ten doctorates."
yoongi twists around to look at taehyung.
"that's really impressive, tae."
"it was over the span of 170 years," taehyung says, smiling ruefully.
"if you had that kind of time, you’d have done the same if not more, i’m sure of it.
living 14,000 years didn't make me a genius.
i just had time."
time.
it is the one thing they don’t have anymore.
and suspended in the air, seconds quickly ticking down to their doom, yoongi can’t help but think that it is all useless.
all this waiting, it’s useless.
that no one has come to their rescue because everybody else is dead.
that they could hold out for as long as possible, but help still wouldn’t come.
that yoongi and taehyung are the only people left alive in the world, and even if yoongi killed taehyung with the one remaining bullet in the pistol, he’d still be trapped in the elevator till he either starved, died of suffocation, or stabbed himself to death with his knife.
whichever came first.
either way, they are going to die.
they are going to die, and for some reason yoongi can only care about the mass of unspoken feelings crammed in his chest.
"time," he whispers past the lump in his throat as he tilts his head to rest it on taehyung’s shoulder.
"we can't see it.
can't hear it.
can't measure it in a laboratory.
it’s simply a subjective sense of becoming what we are from what we were a second ago."
"the hopis see time as a landscape existing before and behind us, and that we move through it slice by slice," taehyung says softly, his voice low and warm, and yoongi can feel him looking at him.
he turns his head to meet taehyung’s gaze and feels the air suddenly grow heavier.
taehyung’s eyes are dark, and yoongi's breath gets caught in his throat.
he can’t form words, can't make a single sound when taehyung draws back his arm from where it was wrapped around yoongi’s waist, fingers skimming across yoongi’s back and sending a shiver up his spine.
taehyung reaches down between them where yoongi’s hand rests in his lap, and yoongi lets him uncurl his fist, mouth parting in a shaky exhale when taehyung’s fingers start to trace the shape of his fingers and knuckles slowly.
yoongi squeezes his eyes shut.
his chest feels so tight, a phantom pain seizing him all of a sudden and squeezing his lungs hard, and yoongi falls forward, just a little, till he feels the warmth of taehyung’s exhales hit his face.
it’s too much, and yoongi presses down on his eyes till it hurts.
they’re going to die.
yoongi can feel the tremors in taehyung’s breathing against his chest.
they’re going to die.
and it’s pathetic that yoongi still can’t muster up the courage to tell taehyung.
i love you, he thinks and parts his lips to speak it, but the words hit the back of his throat and refuse to go any further.
i love you, he wants to cry, i love you i love you i love you.
yoongi bites back the tears in his eyes and tries to keep his ribcage from bursting out of his skin, too small to contain the growing heap of unspoken things threatening to crawl up to his throat and choke him.
too caught up in the storm of his feelings, he misses when taehyung interlaces their fingers together and leans forward.
when taehyung presses his lips against his forehead, yoongi’s eyes fly open.
"thank you," taehyung says, so softly that yoongi can’t tell if he was meant to hear it.
he feels taehyung mouth the words against his skin, but yoongi is frozen stiff, too scared to look up.
something about the whole gesture, very suddenly, feels like some fucked up extended farewell.
and yoongi tries not to choke.
his ribs ache each time he breathes in slowly in an attempt to quell the mounting panic.
this is it.
this is the end.
they’re going to have to make a decision very soon, one that is going to cost at least one of their lives.
most probably both.
they’re going to die.
i love you fuck, he wishes they had more time.
and it isn't the first time that yoongi finds his thoughts returning to the start.
the start of their end.
he remembers how taehyung grew less and less talkative during the last few weeks; and where yoongi always thought that he was like a star bursting forth with his brightness, in the last few days, it felt as if taehyung was rapidly shrinking into himself like a black hole.
he barely responded to yoongi's questions, and the few conversations they had always quickly escalated into arguments.
yoongi could tell that taehyung had something on his mind, but each time he tried to approach him about it, taehyung would lash out like a cornered animal.
yoongi wasn't able to pay a lot of attention to taehyung either, buried up to his neck in the workload the dean had dumped on him with the dangling bait of tenure.
that excuse feels so irrelevant now, but yoongi hadn't thought that his rough patch with taehyung was as serious.
he'd assumed that his husband would come around and share whatever it was that was bothering him and the whole thing would simply blow over.
divorce was the last thing on his mind; in fact, it wasn't there at all.
the thought never even crossed his mind until taehyung ambushed him on the one evening yoongi had managed to get off work on time.
he'd placed the papers before him and told him that he believed it was the best course of action for them.
and just like that, in the course of the nine weeks that followed, yoongi had watched his entire life fall apart before his eyes.
taehyung had disappeared soon after the legal proceedings ended.
there was no trace left of him.
he'd quit his job at the university, and all of his social media was gone.
the one drunken attempt at dialling his number had informed yoongi that taehyung had changed his phone number as well.
he was gone.
up until hoseok introduced him to the team three months ago and taehyung entered their laboratory, his eyes finding yoongi's almost instantly, and yoongi thought that he'd finally lost his goddamn mind.
that the ghost of taehyung was going to haunt him outside of his nightmares too.
the feeling returns to him once again as taehyung’s lips graze down to where yoongi's eyelashes fan out against his cheek, pressing a kiss there like he’s trying to memorize the curl of each lash.
the gesture has yoongi digging his nails into the flesh of taehyung’s palm in an attempt to hold down the sob building at the back of his throat.
they stay like that, breathing in each other’s air.
there is something grave and final in the silence that has yoongi breathing through his nose, terrified that if he dares to part his mouth, he’ll cry and won’t be able to stop.
neither of them attempt to break the silence.
yoongi knows that there’s no use.
there’s no time left.
they won’t make it.
taehyung’s shaking grows worse, and yoongi doesn’t dare look up to see how far up the veins have climbed.
everything is eerily still, an uneasy calm that doesn’t seem to fade.
yoongi waits for something—anything—to announce the end of the world, but nothing comes.
the night continues so silently, it nearly drives him insane.
in the end, yoongi doesn’t know how long they remain like that: taehyung trembling in yoongi’s arms as they both wait, ready for the ground to open its jaw wide and swallow them whole.
it feels like an eternity yet nothing at all.
and yoongi had pictured the end to come in all kinds of ways, from him sinking a bullet in taehyung’s skull to taehyung sinking his teeth in yoongi's throat to the elevator hurtling them straight down to hell.
he didn’t expect namjoon’s voice to be it though.
"yoongi-hyung?"
the speaker flickers to life, namjoon’s panicked voice filtering through it.
and yoongi is up on his feet before namjoon can finish.
"taehyung-ah?
thank god.
we’ve been looking for you two," namjoon says again, and yoongi scrambles towards the other end of the elevator, almost tripping over the corpse in his haste to reach the control panel and press the button for his voice to go through the call.
"joon-ah," he breathes into the microphone.
"you need to power on the elevator.
right now."
"hyung, are you both al—" namjoon starts, but yoongi cuts him off right away.
"namjoon, now," he hisses urgently.
behind him, there’s the quiet reminder of taehyung’s strained breathing, and for the first time, yoongi feels a fragile hope bloom in his chest.
they have a way out.
they might make it.
"actually—" there’s a shuffling sound, voices in the background, and namjoon’s voice cuts off abruptly.
"what—" yoongi starts frantically because that didn’t sound like a yes, but he’s interrupted by a new voice.
"yoongi."
it is seokjin.
and yoongi is about to snap at him to stop wasting time, but seokjin is speaking again.
"yoongi, what’s wrong with taehyung?"
yoongi freezes.
they must be watching the camera footage, he realises, and his forehead is still warm from where taehyung had kissed it, but everything else is growing cold because yoongi knows what is about to happen.
and he can’t.
he can’t bring himself to answer, can’t bring himself to breathe, an ice-cold fear creeping under all of his skin and chilling him to the bone, freezing him stiff.
everything is still.
yoongi can't speak.
"i was infected."
it’s taehyung who answers quietly behind him.
and the silence that follows is suffocating.
a sufficient answer in itself.
this must be what it feels like to get stabbed, yoongi thinks, and he gnashes his teeth together, crowding against the elevator once again.
"seokjin, we have the serum," he hisses urgently.
"we can't waste time.
you—" "yoongi," seokjin starts to say, something between pity and regret.
"no," yoongi interrupts him before he can continue.
his knees are trembling, and if he wasn’t holding the wall as hard as he was, he’d have collapsed already.
"there’s still time.
we can—" seokjin’s voice cuts in again, this time sharper.
"we have no way of knowing the serum will work."
"so you won’t even fucking try?"
yoongi screams this time, voice splitting and echoing in the elevator.
everything is suddenly too quiet.
taehyung is painfully silent, and yoongi feels his body shake violently, panic throttling him of all rational thought.
"you’re going to abandon him just like that?
and live the rest of your life knowing that you could’ve saved him but you didn’t?"
"i’m not going to risk the entire operation for one person, yoongi.
taehyung is my friend too, or do you think i’m doing this for my enjoyment?"
"you won’t even fucking try!"
yoongi yells back, voice thick with tears.
"you’re killing him!
not the virus!
not the zombies!
but you!"
seokjin is quiet, and yoongi’s chest heaves.
but this time it’s taehyung’s voice that cuts in between them.
"hyung," he says and rasps in a breath so rough it hurts to hear.
yoongi turns around and freezes when he catches sight of him.
taehyung must’ve been trying to crawl closer but he’s fallen forward on his elbows.
he’s trying to lift himself off the floor but his arms are shaking, and yoongi is about to scream at him not to move, but taehyung’s next words stop him dead.
"please get yoongi out of here," taehyung says, sagged almost completely to the floor and struggling to push himself off it, but he can barely lift his head.
his teeth are chattering, and yoongi’s heart freezes stiff when taehyung does manage to look up.
there are veins.
all the way up to his lips.
like they’re trying to creep inside his mouth and suffocate him.
"i’ll stay inside," taehyung says, and his lips are split and dry.
they bleed when he moves them.
"you can—you can lower me back down again.
but please get him out of here."
"no," yoongi whispers, eyes wide with horror.
he wants to scream, but all that leaves his mouth is a loud ugly sob.
"no—i won’t let you."
taehyung clenches his jaw tight.
his face is so pale.
dark blue veins crawl under his skin like roots, and yoongi watches him force himself up, leaning on his good arm to take his weight.
"at least one of us needs to make it out alive," taehyung says, not meeting yoongi’s eyes.
there’s blood gathering inside his mouth and between his teeth.
"and both of us know that it’s not going to be me."
"taehyung—" "you’ll die!"
taehyung screams, his head jerking up with force.
it’s the first time yoongi is seeing taehyung look so broken.
his whole body is shaking, chest caving in with each harsh breath.
"don’t you understand?
if any of us deserves to live, it’s you!"
"that’s not for you to decide," yoongi spits back at him.
"you two aren’t the only ones trying to reach the top," seokjin’s voice interrupts them, pausing long enough for his words to sink in.
"the other lifts are crammed with the infected," he says.
then, slowly, like he knows the weight of his next words.
"we can’t bring the power back on."
yoongi’s heart stops.
and for a moment, he is frozen on his spot, motionless.
seokjin keeps speaking; and there are more voices now, indistinct but insistent enough that yoongi can tell that they're arguing.
he can’t make out what they’re saying over the roaring pulse in his ears.
stomach twisting with a sudden wave of nausea, yoongi grabs the edge of the wall when he feels his knees shake and threaten to sink him to the floor.
but before he can fall, namjoon’s voice comes through the speaker once again.
"actually, each elevator is hooked to an emergency power supply that runs on battery," he reveals slowly, like he’s not sure whether he should disclose the information.
"but it’s not a lot.
probably just enough to get you to the nineteenth if we're lucky.
you understand what that means, right?
taehyung?"
there’s too much going on for yoongi to think.
his vision swims, but yoongi grits his teeth, willing himself to stay steady.
he can’t pass out.
he’s so scared.
"i understand," taehyung rasps.
"we’ll operate the elevator on its battery for yoongi to reach the nineteenth floor safely," namjoon tells them.
there’s a pause, and it’s the only warning yoongi gets.
"but once we’ve retrieved him, taehyung, we’ll have to eliminate you on sight."
yoongi stops breathing.
"yes.
that is fine," taehyung agrees.
"what," yoongi screams, choked with disbelief.
he slams his fist against the control panel, chest heaving with panicked breaths.
"what the fuck.
namjoon, you can’t do that!
you can’t fucking do that!"
"we are in no way prepared to contain another outbreak," seokjin snaps this time.
"you can’t see what we can.
you don’t understand the situation—" "no!
you don't understand the situation!"
yoongi shouts.
he feels wild.
it’s a gamble, just like everything else, but it’s all he has.
"listen to me," yoongi starts slowly, squeezing his eyes shut as he tries to force his voice steady.
"taehyung is—he’s the key to finding the cure, i’m sure of it.
you have to save him.
it may be a risk, but without him, the entire operation is doomed."
"what do you mean?"
seokjin’s tone is cautious.
"you have to believe me," yoongi begs, and he can’t hold his tears anymore.
he lets his head fall and collide against the control panel in resignation, voice growing thicker the longer he speaks.
"please, i’m not lying.
he’s—he’s not—you can’t kill him."
"yoongi—" seokjin starts, but it is clear that he doesn’t believe him.
"hyung, please save him," yoongi gasps, throat closing in as he bangs his fist against the wall and cries.
"he’s going to die, please.
i—i’m begging you, please save him."
seokjin is silent, and yoongi’s body shakes with the force of his sobs.
"please, please, please, please," he whispers, pressing down on his eyes hard enough to crush them.
the thought of losing taehyung is so unbearable, his chest clenches tight and he can’t breathe.
everything hurts, everything hurts so much, and yoongi feels so fucking powerless to stop it.
everything is silent for a moment.
finally, seokjin makes a sound as if to say something, but whatever he was about to say is silenced by a loud thud.
yoongi jerks his head up to look at the ceiling where the sound came from.
and there’s another thud, so sudden and strong that yoongi startles.
"yoongi?"
seokjin sounds concerned, but yoongi slowly steps away from the control panel, dread climbing up his spine and stiffening it.
the noise repeats again and again, somehow louder each time, and it’s as if something heavy is colliding against metal repeatedly.
the doors, yoongi realises with growing horror.
the doors to the elevator on the floor above them.
something is pounding against them.
something like dozens and dozens of infected bodies.
they must’ve heard all the noise, yoongi realises just as the doors groan once again under the strain, an awful screeching metallic sound so loud in the silence that yoongi knows that if nothing else, this is the end of the world.
yoongi swallows, and with an impossible amount of effort, slowly twists his neck to look back at taehyung— and feels his entire world come plummeting down on top of him.
taehyung is lying face down in the pool of blood.
he isn’t moving.
and this time, yoongi does fall, all noise strangled to silence in his throat as he drops to his knees before taehyung.
the world is dead silent save for the brutal sounds of bodies barrelling against metal again and again and again.
but yoongi no longer cares if the doors fly off their jambs.
doesn’t care if namjoon and seokjin are still watching.
with shaking hands, he pulls taehyung up by his armpits and flips him over so he’s lying on his back.
taehyung’s wound has started bleeding again, which is fine.
he can fix this.
it will be okay.
he can fix this.
he has to.
because there is no other option.
because yoongi has no one other than taehyung in this entire world.
the banging continues, and yoongi feels the lift under his feet shift unsteadily.
but what scares him even more is how limp taehyung is in his arms, his clammy hand gripped tight in yoongi’s.
is he even breathing?
shaking with something far worse than the cold, yoongi swings a leg over taehyung's hips and kneels down to bring an ear close to his bloody lips and listen for any signs of breathing.
nothing swallowing down the urge to sob, yoongi pulls away and lets go of taehyung’s hand before bringing down the heels of his palms to the center of taehyung’s chest and thumping it hard once, twice, thrice.
"taehyung, come on," he cries and continues pushing his hands down on taehyung’s chest again and again and again.
there is that choking feeling again, like yoongi’s ribs are being crushed into splinters.
there is so much that he wants to say, so much that he wishes he’d said.
but now he doesn’t think he’ll ever get the chance to.
the lift shakes, rattles, and the sounds of nails scratching against metal grate against yoongi’s ears.
and yoongi is crying now.
he’s really crying now, and he hates it.
everything hurts, and yoongi keeps compressing taehyung’s chest in hopes of getting him to breathe again, but he can’t help but think that he’s already too late.
"don’t do this," yoongi begs him.
but he can’t hear anything over the sounds of the doors screeching like they’re curving under the strain and bending in, in, in.
taehyung doesn’t respond.
"i love you," yoongi cries, voice breaking on the words.
"i love you so much.
please.
don’t do this."
don’t die on me.
taehyung’s face looks gray in the pale white light, blood on his nose and mouth, and a thicket of dark blue veins running under his thin skin, all the way up to his translucent eyelids.
yoongi tilts taehyung’s chin up and holds it in place as he pinches his nose shut with his other hand.
he leans down to press his mouth over taehyung’s and feels taehyung’s chest rise when he blows a breath into his lungs.
he pulls back to gasp in an inhale before he's dipping down again.
and then again.
and again.
and he’s crying into taehyung’s mouth.
he doesn’t know what else to do.
doesn’t know if there’s anything left to do.
the lift shakes dangerously, and yoongi holds onto taehyung desperately.
this is how it ends—yoongi’s entire life, and this is how it ends.
every crash into the doors feels like the last one.
and yoongi hates that some part of him is waiting for it, for it all to be over.
he braces for it, for the doors to finally give in and fall and crush the roof of the elevator.
for the cable wires to snap and send them all plummeting down to their deaths.
but taehyung gasps then.
and yoongi’s eyes fly open.
he releases him and jerks back to see taehyung’s eyes fluttering before screwing back shut in pain.
"it hurts," he croaks out, making a vaguely distressed noise.
yoongi’s lungs almost collapse with relief, and he sags down to press a kiss to taehyung’s forehead.
"w-what’s wrong?"
taehyung stutters out when yoongi pulls off him, blue lips trembling around the shape of the words.
he twists his neck to look at him, eyes glazed and unfocused.
and that’s when it hits yoongi.
his eyes.
they’re gray.
"y-yoongi?"
taehyung calls out again when yoongi doesn’t respond, reaching out with a trembling hand to feel for him.
he can’t see.
there is blood on his mouth and the side of his face—his ear is soaked in it—and his hazy gray eyes flit around wildly in panic as taehyung tries to grasp his surroundings.
"did the lights go out?
why is it so—" taehyung stops abruptly, and yoongi watches the realisation sink into the lines of his face before cementing there thickly.
taehyung blinks rapidly, mouth parting and then closing before he brings his shaking fingers to his face, tentatively patting the skin under his right eye.
yoongi squeezes his eyes shut, clenching his teeth hard to hold back the sob threatening to leave his lips, but he must’ve made a sound because he feels taehyung’s fingers reach out to hold his face, thumbs gently brushing away the tears on his cheeks.
"don’t cry," taehyung whispers.
"please don’t cry."
yoongi opens his eyes to taehyung’s ashen face and the blood splattered across it.
clumps of his bangs are stuck to his forehead, and the dark veins that engulf his face are so horrifying, yoongi has to swallow back vomit.
so bruised, bloody, and broken, taehyung looks just as dead as the corpse on yoongi’s left.
"yoon—" taehyung starts to say, but he’s silenced by the loud screeching sounds of the doors as they put up one final fight before giving away completely.
in that brief moment they get before yoongi is certain that this is how they die, he watches the way taehyung’s eyes grow wide, fear hardening between the lines of his face right as the doors slam into the roof and the entire car shakes so violently, yoongi loses his balance and just manages to catch himself on his elbows before he can go crashing into taehyung.
the lights go out, and yoongi doesn’t dare to breathe as the dark suddenly consumes them.
frozen stiff to his bones with fear, he feels hyperaware of every sound of the creaking suspended elevator.
any movement might cause the car to tip over.
"yoongi," taehyung starts again, no louder than a whisper.
their faces are only inches apart with yoongi’s body on top of taehyung’s, caging it as the emergency lights swing above their heads precariously.
yoongi stops him, grabbing his wrist tight because something else is coming.
and it does.
there is that awful shrieking sound and the first infected falls on the roof with a loud sickening thud .
the car wobbles dangerously, and one of the lights falls and smashes to pieces on the floor right behind them.
yoongi presses closer to taehyung, curling over him protectively.
"yoongi, look at me," taehyung says, turning yoongi’s face towards him with the wet palm on his cheek.
"it's okay," he whispers even though yoongi can feel his hand trembling against his skin.
another thud.
then a third in quick succession, and yoongi swears he hears the metal beams screeching and crumbling under the weight.
they’re going to fall.
they’re going to fall straight down to their deaths, but yoongi can’t look away from taehyung’s white eyes.
"it’s going to be okay," taehyung is saying, and yoongi can make out his bloodied lips stretching into a smile.
he might have believed him if taehyung’s eyes weren’t glistening wet with unshed tears.
it’s not going to be okay.
taehyung’s fingers caress yoongi’s cheek, leaving bloody tracks as taehyung traces his thumb along the arch of his eyebrow, then down the slope of his nose before stopping where his upper lip dips slightly.
"i wish i could see your face," taehyung whispers quietly, and yoongi's face crumples.
the metal roof is creaking under the strain, threatening to tear open, and yoongi squeezes his eyes shut when the elevator slides forward in a sharp decline.
they’re going to fall.
any second now.
they’re going to die.
"i love you," yoongi croaks out, and taehyung’s fingers still on his face.
he doesn’t dare to open his eyes to see taehyung’s face, just swallows and musters up all his courage before he loses the chance.
"i love you so much.
and i—i know—i know that you don’t feel the same, but still i want to say that—i love you, and i’m sorry i—i can’t help it.
i—i—" the lift jolts with a jarring jerk, and this is it, yoongi thinks.
this is the end.
the car creaks, and with a loud groaning sound, heaves up their weight as it starts to climb up its shaft.
it takes yoongi a moment to realise that they aren’t falling, and then his eyes fly wide open.
he yanks up his head to look at the control panel.
eight the number glows in the dark, and yoongi hears the screams of the infected as they slide off the roof of the car and the elevator slowly makes its ascent.
there’s a crackle of the speaker buzzing to life, and seokjin’s broken voice comes again.
can ...
two of you hear me?
he asks, his voice breaking through in bursts in between the static and screams.
we … managed … you … reach us … so stay put ...
until ...
eliminate the threat.
i repeat … stay put.
seokjin’s voice cuts off just as quickly as it came, and for a moment, yoongi remains frozen where he is.
until the brutal realisation of just who seokjin was calling a threat slams into him.
and then yoongi is scrambling up.
he cannot see a thing in the dark, and he’s scared of making any unnecessary movements that might cause the elevator car to finally tip over and fall.
he blindly pats for taehyung’s arm, searching for the knife he’d used to wind the tourniquet.
in the giant scheme of things, yoongi’s feelings are of little importance, which means he’s better off focusing on the things that he can fix instead.
like making sure taehyung doesn’t lose any more blood than he already has.
he has to save him; he’ll put himself between seokjin’s bullet and him if he has to.
he won't lose him again.
he can’t.
but just as yoongi reaches his arm, taehyung grabs his wrist and holds him there.
"yoongi, stop it," he murmurs and pulls his hand away to tangle their fingers together instead.
"you’ve done so much already."
yoongi shakes his head even though taehyung can’t see him.
he’s crying again, and he hates it almost as much as everything else.
if he’d done enough, they wouldn’t be here like this.
"thank you, hyung," taehyung says, and it’s just three words, but there is so much weight and sincerity in them that yoongi feels like he’s been gutted.
he stares at taehyung’s blind eyes and the blood that smears over his teeth as he speaks.
"i need you to do just one last thing for me," taehyung whispers.
"please.
it’s important."
"yeah," yoongi gasps out, breathless.
"yeah, anything.
what is it?"
"i need you to run," taehyung says, and he tightens his hold on yoongi's hand as soon as he senses that yoongi is about to fight him.
"when these doors open, i need you to run away from me.
i need you to run for your life."
"you can’t—" yoongi croaks out.
"yoongi."
taehyung smiles, pained and soft.
"please."
it’s unfair, yoongi wants to scream at him, but he can’t bring himself to speak.
"one of us should live through this.
please.
promise me," taehyung urges him.
he’s shaking all over, and yoongi’s hand grows numb from how hard taehyung squeezes it, like it is the only thing holding him together.
"promise me that you’re going to escape," taehyung says, his voice growing desperate as he pulls yoongi closer and whispers against his lips.
"promise me—you’re going to live."
yoongi is still shaking his head.
the digits on the control panel blur against his tears, but yoongi can still make out the glowing eleven.
"no," he says.
he feels taehyung’s lips part but cuts him off before he can speak.
"no, you don’t get to do this."
"yoongi—" "it was supposed to be me!"
yoongi gasps, and his arms shake to hold up his weight.
below him, taehyung goes quiet.
"why did you do it?"
he goes on, voice brittle.
"it was me who was going to be bitten!
why did you—" he doesn’t get to make it to the end of the question before his voice cracks, and he sounds so broken he might as well have been screaming.
"because you didn’t deserve to die," taehyung says quietly.
"you don’t get to fucking decide that!"
"i would do it again," taehyung says, his jaw clenched tight with a stubbornness that yoongi hasn’t ever seen before.
"i would do it a thousand more times if it meant there was even the slightest chance that you’d get to live."
taehyung’s chest heaves as he pants, each breath so harsh in the silence, and it’s only when he blinks that yoongi realises—he’s crying.
"tae…" yoongi says, but taehyung twists his face away.
tears run down his cheek, and yoongi wipes them away with his thumb.
"please don't cry," he whispers, and when taehyung sobs, it crushes yoongi’s entire heart.
"it’s going to be okay," he begins saying.
"we’re going to get through this—" "during the black plague," taehyung interrupts him as he rolls his head back to face yoongi, eyes wet and unfocused.
"you died in my arms."
yoongi freezes.
he knows, suddenly, that this is a story he doesn’t want to hear.
"before that, my devotees pinned you to a stake and burnt you alive because they believed you’d corrupted me."
yoongi’s face twists once the meaning slowly starts to dawn on him.
"taehyung," he says, and wants it to mean stop.
"1561, you were hung on a noose for a prince’s enjoyment.
in 1630, you took your own life to escape slavery.
in 1899, you got crushed under a truck, and in 1973, you were beaten with stones till you bled to death."
in the gray half-light, death looms low and heavy, and taehyung inhales sharply.
"over and over—" his voice, once so flat, cracks terribly, "you seemed to die of everything but age."
taehyung laughs like he’s choking, and even in the dark, yoongi can see his face shiny with tear tracks.
"maybe there was some truth to those stories, maybe i am stealing lives.
your lives.
i’ve been killing you over and over again and living off the stolen years."
"that can’t be true," yoongi says, strangled, but it sounds weak even to his own ears.
taehyung turns his face away so he’s facing the ceiling even though his eyes remain white and vacant.
he’s shaking like a leaf, and yoongi wants to say something—anything—but his voice fails him.
"nothing lasts forever, i told you that once," taehyung says so quietly, yoongi has to strain to hear it over the sound of their panting.
"but it’s not true."
"forever is—" he gasps out and closes his eyes, "forever is the way i feel for you."
taehyung is shivering wildly, and yoongi wants to reach up and soothe him, but he’s frozen to his bones.
"so min yoongi—" taehyung hiccups.
he’s so cold, and his hand tightens around yoongi’s, "please do not think i don’t love you."
taehyung’s eyes clench so tight, it creases his forehead.
"my love for you is the only thing that has existed as long as i have," he lifts his eyes slowly and presses their joint hands to his cheek, "for i have not known a time when you weren’t the only thing that mattered to me."
yoongi's throat grows painfully tight, and what little breath he had left withers and dies.
for a long moment, the only sound that remains is that of the metallic doors screeching against the walls of the shaft as the elevator slowly carries their weight to the top.
the silence is heavy, and there's no sound from the speaker.
it's just him and taehyung.
all alone.
the admission shouldn't matter—not now, not when they're literally seconds away from being shredded apart by bullets.
it shouldn't matter—but it does matter.
it matters because it's taehyung.
it's taehyung, and yoongi doesn't want to think about what awaits them outside this elevator, not when the rest of him is just thinking i love you i love you i love you.
taehyung doesn’t look like he’s breathing, and yoongi drops down on his elbows till their chests are touching.
he settles a palm on taehyung’s jaw instead, and taehyung flinches, but yoongi doesn’t move.
he doesn’t know what makes him do it.
maybe it is the wet unfocused haze of taehyung’s eyes and the way they don’t rest on yoongi’s face because he can’t see him.
(and might never be able to see him.) or maybe it is the dreadful fourteen becoming fifteen in the corner of his vision.
maybe it’s none of that, but yoongi doesn’t care enough to find out because he’s squeezing his eyes shut and leaning down and kissing the corner of taehyung’s lips quietly.
taehyung goes very, very still.
yoongi presses harder, desperately, to say what he cannot say with words.
he digs his fingers into taehyung’s with intent and kisses taehyung’s cheeks, his nose and his forehead, his chin and his lips.
"we’ll make it out of here," he whispers, voice trembling.
"and—and we can go stargazing, and you can be a nerd and tell me all about the lambda-cdm model."
he feels the corners of taehyung’s lips lift up in a strained smile.
"i’ll grill us beef—we’ll steal some from seokjin."
"he wouldn’t talk to either of us for a month," taehyung whispers, more air than voice.
"you know how petty he can get."
"it’s what he deserves for hoarding all the food."
he hears taehyung’s quiet and tired laugh.
and in that moment, yoongi thinks that he’ll be okay with this.
not that he has a choice.
he has to be.
taehyung doesn't ask how many floors remain.
and yoongi doesn't tell.
sixteen yoongi never knew wanting something could hurt so much.
they lie in silence for a moment, and taehyung shifts again, searching.
his aim is a little off, mouth landing on the corner of yoongi’s lips, but yoongi corrects him with the palm on his jaw.
they’re kissing, but taehyung is shaking too badly.
his body is so cold, it does something awful to yoongi.
"taehyung?"
he whispers, pulling back a little, but there’s no reply.
he lets go of taehyung’s hand slowly, but taehyung makes a weak noise of protest, and his grip, that was tight already, turns into a vice.
"your hand is warm," taehyung mumbles, the words barely leaving his lips.
his eyes are closed, and his body is so cold, trembling so violently, yoongi swallows down the sourness in his throat and gently brushes taehyung’s fringe back with the hand that’s not gripped tight in taehyung’s like the point of contact is all that’s keeping him from thrashing out in blind helplessness.
"it’s okay.
it’s going to be alright," he whispers against taehyung's lips and hopes, desperately, that it’ll be enough even though they both know that it’s not.
it’s not going to be okay.
seventeen "i’m sorry," taehyung speaks again, and yoongi can tell how much the effort exhausts him.
"i lied to you."
"it’s okay," yoongi whispers.
"no," taehyung pants, swallowing hard.
his face is pale, the blood between his teeth dark.
"you—you should be angry."
"i’m not angry."
"you should be!"
"taehyung—" "i d-don’t understand."
taehyung's voice is broken, and it's hard to understand him now, over the sound of his sobs.
"you—i lied to you.
for years—i—" "tae...i’m not angry, i swear," yoongi tries to placate him.
"you should," taehyung croaks out, his voice twisting and falling apart in a way yoongi can’t understand.
it’s okay, he tries to tell him again, but the words get caught in his throat because something in taehyung’s face is changing, and before he can blink, yoongi’s back is slammed hard against the floor as taehyung flips them over and looms over him.
yoongi’s mouth parts open with pain, but no sound comes out.
there’s something wild in taehyung’s eyes, and yoongi’s throat dries.
part of him knew all this time.
that it was going to end like this.
(nothing lasts forever.) "you should hate me," taehyung gasps.
"i love you," yoongi repeats, and taehyung’s face crumples.
veins swarming his face, his mouth and neck and chest, taehyung’s teeth don’t show when he grimaces.
his lips are red and bloodied, and he—he doesn’t look like taehyung at all.
yoongi isn’t even sure if the man staring down at him is taehyung anymore, and the thought chills him to his core.
there is so much he wants to say, but there is no time, and yoongi doesn't move when taehyung traces his fingers along his jaw, his chin.
he lets taehyung tilt his head back and parts his lips when taehyung sweeps a thumb across them.
eighteen all things come to an end, and yoongi aches from so much crying.
"i love you," taehyung says, but his voice is all wrong, and now that yoongi knows to listen for it, it sounds a lot more like i'm sorry.
yoongi feels his heart clench with so much pain.
he lifts his hand and settles his palm against taehyung’s wet cheek, cupping it very slowly before urging him closer.
"don’t," taehyung says, and he sounds more terrified than yoongi’s ever heard, his voice twisting into something foreign, something wilder, something so wrong.
"i love you too," yoongi whispers, and he hears taehyung sob, panicked breaths shrieking out of him as he trembles and tries to control himself.
the world is painfully quiet, and when yoongi pulls him down, taehyung kisses him but it's nothing like the previous kiss.
it's harsh and forceful, none of the tenderness to it.
and yoongi is shaking all over because he’s thinking of taehyung stealing his lives, and there must be something wrong with him because yoongi lets him, always lets him.
he lets taehyung force a thumb inside his mouth; he isn't kissing him as much as he's forcibly pushing yoongi's jaw open.
and crushed up so small underneath him, yoongi opens his mouth wide and lets taehyung push all of his fingers and teeth and blood onto his tongue and throat till it feels like he’s being buried alive.
for better or worse, he’ll give all his years to taehyung.
each time yoongi tries to breathe, he feels the blood seep down further inside his burning lungs.
the conflict feels a world away, and for whatever reason, the end of it all is so quiet.
the feel of taehyung—his fingers and teeth sunk in yoongi’s mouth and their chests pressed together—it drowns out everything else.
even the ding!
of the elevator doors.
nineteen and then the seemingly endless thunder of bullets barrelling into metal.
the quiet that engulfs them when the doors close at last, the last of their guests finally herded out of their home, is foreboding.
it hangs dense and heavy over their heads, but after three years of marriage, yoongi knows it for what it is: the calm that comes before a cloudburst.
he hears taehyung, behind him, twist around and bid their droids and chauffeur goodnight, relieving them from their duty for the night.
and yoongi stands facing the closed doors for a long moment, until he feels taehyung’s eyes on his spine; then he knows he can no longer forestall it.
bracing himself, he twists around as well and strides to the kitchen to pull out two fresh glasses from the overhead cabinet.
one for taehyung, and a stronger one for himself; he brings their drinks to the living room where taehyung has settled in his chair in front of the television screen.
yoongi sits on the couch in silence, and taehyung sinks back into his chair with his drink, ice cubes clinking against the glass as he crosses his legs and plays the party's footage, taken by the house droids, on the large flat panel display affixed to the wall.
yoongi absently watches the night’s highlights play on the screen as he takes a sip of his whiskey.
next to him, taehyung remains silent.
"tired?"
yoongi asks him.
there is no real care or an intent to seek an answer, but he watches taehyung’s head turn, eyes slowly sliding to meet his own.
his husband doesn’t reply; instead, his face grows darker, the grip on his drink growing tighter, and taehyung suddenly brings the glass to his lips and drains it in one swallow even though there was half of it—more than half of it remaining.
he doesn’t look away from yoongi the entire time, even as he leans forward and slams the glass down on the coffee table with a force that resounds through the quiet house.
"are you embarrassed?"
taehyung says all of a sudden, wiping his mouth harshly with the back of his hand, and yoongi looks up at him sharply, eyes narrowed.
"because it was embarrassing to watch you."
"what are you talking about?"
he asks, slowly, as he turns to face taehyung fully, but taehyung is already grabbing the remote and pausing the party’s highlights that had still been playing in the background.
he leans back in his chair, gaze calm, but yoongi can see the storm brewing in his eyes, dark gray clouds rolling in through his pupils.
"him."
he jerks his chin towards the screen in one sharp motion, and yoongi slowly twists his neck to look at what taehyung was talking about.
he goes stiff when he sees a frozen still of him and jimin from two hours ago.
they’re standing in a secluded corner of the living room, and yoongi remembers jimin had been giving everybody in the party stupid names.
jimin is grinning, and yoongi is frozen mid-laugh, both of them turned towards each other, oblivious of everybody else in the room.
it’s nothing incriminating, but with how murderous taehyung looks, it does not need to be.
yoongi turns around to meet taehyung’s gaze once again, no expression on his face but knuckles hard against his tight grip on the glass.
coolly, he says, "what about him?"
taehyung’s face hardens, lash-lined eyes growing dark, and his jaw sharp against the yellow lights overhead.
yoongi feels like a clock is ticking somewhere in the silence between them, like minutes pass as they stare at each other in a tense unblinking provocation, even though it’s been no more than a few seconds.
"you were flirting with park jimin in front of our entire fucking team."
the fury is plain to see on his face now, and yoongi rolls his eyes, purposely, because he knows how much taehyung hates it.
"we were just talking," he says with an air of exasperation and grips the glass tighter when it threatens to quiver.
then lifting one eyebrow, he tilts his head and drawls, "you were the one who invited him, remember?
was i meant to ignore him?"
"yes," taehyung hisses, jaw clenched tight.
"i invited him here to humiliate him.
the entire fucking—" he pinches the bridge of his nose with a thumb and his index finger, "the whole point of the event was to show him that he has no allies here.
but you—" taehyung snaps his head back up to stare at yoongi, and something in his gaze sends a shiver rolling down the back of yoongi's neck.
but he steels himself even as taehyung’s black eyes flicker between the white knuckles on his glass and his face.
"you fucking embarrass me," his husband hisses at him, enunciates it slow and deliberate, and yoongi presses his lips into a hard, firm line.
he lets taehyung know just how ridiculous he thinks he’s being by keeping eye contact with him as he slams his glass down on the table as well and pushes himself off his seat.
but he hasn’t taken two steps forward when taehyung has grabbed him by the wrist tightly and stopped him in his tracks.
"sit down.
you aren’t going anywhere," he says with a note of finality, not looking at him.
his eyes are on the screen, and yoongi stares at him with exasperation but makes no move to sit even when taehyung lets go of him.
the skin on his wrist stings, imprints from the bracelets now pressed where taehyung held him, but yoongi drops it and lets it hang beside him.
taehyung flicks through the videos on the screen until he finds what he was searching for.
"tell me," he says, gesturing towards the screen loosely with the remote in his hand, and yoongi slowly turns around to look at it.
it’s another shot of yoongi and jimin but more people have joined them, taehyung included.
taehyung presses play.
"i’m a serial monogamist," jimin starts saying.
one hand casually pushed into the pocket of his suit, and a grin on his lips, he swirls the wine in his glass with the other hand.
"i’m staying faithful to my drink right here."
yoongi on-screen laughs, and taehyung freezes the video once again.
"is that funny?"
he asks yoongi now as he shifts to face him.
his voice is flat, and his face has taken on that terrifying impassive nonchalance that reveals nothing.
taehyung leans back in his chair.
there’s a twist to his lips that’s almost cruel as he sits with one arm draped over the back of his chair, long legs crossed, and it has yoongi’s hair standing up.
a shiver streaks down his spine, and he grits his teeth, but right when he parts his lips to say something to convey his incredulity at the interrogation, taehyung shushes him and gestures at the screen once again.
"let’s watch it again."
he rewinds it, and jimin’s smirk is back.
small fingers adorned with rings delicately wrap around the pinot noir as he swirls its red liquid inside.
his earrings sway with every little movement of his head that is tipped to the side with a confident ease.
his long silver hair parted deeply at the side fall in front of his face, and there is that arrogance in his posture and his glittering eyes that yoongi has grown intimately familiar with.
"i’m a serial monogamist," he says, a filthy smirk on his lips, and yoongi hears taehyung quietly scoff from where he’s standing beside him.
but yoongi’s eyes are on himself, and how pleased he looks.
"i’m staying faithful to my drink right here."
yoongi’s quiet laughter resounds again in their empty house.
he isn’t looking in jimin’s direction, but his gums are wide on display before he brings his wine to his lips to conceal it.
taehyung stops the video once again, turning to look at yoongi with those dark eyes.
"so," he lifts his eyebrows, "is that funny, in your opinion?"
"are we really doing this?"
yoongi asks him, little inflection in his voice.
he wants to think that he sounds almost bored, but the two of them have played this game for far too long and, like vultures, they know where the flesh is soft.
they’re both the same kind of vindictive and vengeful after all.
taehyung shrugs, nonchalant.
"i was just wondering.
because nobody, save for you, laughed at it.
it was just objectively not funny.
so you either have a horrid sense of humor, or..."
he trails off, eyes not moving from yoongi’s face as he leans forward to pick yoongi’s drink from the table, and slowly takes a languid sip from it, lips closing around the imprint of yoongi’s own mouth on the rim.
"you’re unbelievable," yoongi deadpans.
"we went through this same shit with hoseok.
and remember how that turned out?"
as expected, taehyung’s face twists with disdain.
"hoseok—he—" "dared to be my friend?"
yoongi retorts, scoffing.
"you’re fucking insane."
taehyung doesn’t respond right away.
yoongi watches him take another long sip until he drains the glass and then knocks it down on the table.
"jimin—" he starts.
"we talked," yoongi enunciates, cutting him off.
he feels on edge; three years and taehyung still has the same effect on him.
nothing’s changed.
"are you going to put me on trial because of it?"
"so i’m being irrational?"
taehyung says, and as calm as he pretends to be, yoongi can see his brow tick with annoyance.
"you’re getting obsessed."
the accusation makes taehyung’s lips press into a thin line, and yoongi forces himself to maintain the stare, an attempt at forging composure.
"well, that’s brilliant."
taehyung smiles, close-lipped and dangerous, and the dread in yoongi’s chest grows.
"because—" he presses another button on the remote, never looking away from yoongi.
"lip read reconstruction enabled," a loud feminine voice resounds in the morbid silence between them, and yoongi’s neck cracks when he whips his head to look at the screen again.
yet another shot of him and jimin—this is when jimin had just entered, and yoongi’s surprise is evident when he catches sight of him in the crowd.
their voices can’t be heard, but the conversation is recreated from the shapes of their moving mouths.
the automated voice is speaking once again, reconstructing and reciting yoongi’s words in bland monotone.
"hey."
yoongi’s lips stretch with surprise as he strides towards jimin.
"i didn’t know you were going to come."
jimin laughs, and his hand briefly comes to touch yoongi’s elbow, a deliberate graze that is gone as soon as it came.
"honestly, i almost didn’t," he admits, and yoongi watches jimin pluck the flute out of his hand and take a slow sip.
"what changed your mind?"
he hears himself ask.
"well," jimin says slowly, his smile gaining more edge as he leans forward and slips the stem of the glass between yoongi’s fingers with purpose.
his eyes glitter with something that makes ice curl its way up to yoongi’s chest.
"you were going to be here, weren’t you?"
yoongi hasn’t moved even when taehyung pauses the video, and he feels taehyung’s unsettling gaze on him.
"so…" his husband drawls, and yoongi turns around slowly, stiff with dread.
his eyes meet taehyung’s, who is resting his chin on his palm as he watches yoongi with vicious amusement, mouth twisted into a knife-like smirk.
"just talking, huh?"
yoongi bristles.
then, biting the bait even as he sees taehyung laying it out for him, he grits out, "fine, we flirted.
are you really going to pretend that you’re jealous?"
taehyung watches him darkly for a moment.
then— "you slept with him."
when yoongi remains silent, jaw clenching hard, taehyung barks out an incredulous laugh.
"you actually slept with him!
this is hilarious!"
"fuck, taehyung, i never gave you shit about jungkook."
jungkook: a pretty thing, and taehyung’s personal secretary.
yoongi had found them joined at the lips in taehyung’s office.
jungkook had looked terrified, but taehyung hadn’t even bothered to remove the arm around jungkook’s waist.
taehyung now uncrosses his legs and stands up.
there are no traces of laughter on his face, and yoongi has to hold back the flinch that threatens to wrack through his body.
"this is different, and you know it," taehyung says lowly, gaze not moving from yoongi’s face, and yoongi feels paralyzed—a rabbit trapped in the eyes of a predator.
when taehyung takes a step towards yoongi, yoongi involuntarily takes one back, heart pounding behind gritted teeth.
"so, how long have you been going out with him?"
the truth is that yoongi had pulled jimin into his bedroom for no reason other than to spite taehyung, and he’s sure that jimin knew it too.
"this is stupid."
he makes a move to turn around, but taehyung grabs him by the arm and yanks him back.
"you can't run from this."
his voice dips low in warning, their noses almost touching.
"answer me.
how long have you been going out with him?"
"does it matter?"
yoongi sneers and snaps his eyes back up.
their faces are so close, and yoongi watches taehyung’s nostrils flare angrily.
"you’re going to believe whatever you want to believe anyway."
"tell me you don’t actually like him."
taehyung’s grip on his bicep tightens, hard enough to leave bruises, and yoongi bites down on his tongue to keep the noise in his throat from leaving his lips.
"let me guess, you’re just doing it to get a rise out of me.
you are, aren’t you?"
taehyung’s eyes on him are frightening, and when yoongi feels his hands start to shake, he curls them into fists and digs his blunt nails hard into his palms until they cut crescents into his skin.
"it might be news to you, but not everything i do is about you," he hisses, and he feels like he’s breathing too fast, too loud.
when he yanks his arm out of taehyung’s grip, taehyung lets him go.
"maybe if you pulled your head out of your ass for once, you’d realise the world doesn’t revolve around this stupid rivalry between you two."
yoongi stares at himself reflected in taehyung’s eyes, and taehyung stares back, expression unreadable.
"you know, when you suspect something, it's always better when it turns out to be true."
he says casually and laughs for real now, revealing a row of dazzling white teeth that are a contrast to those dark, dark eyes, and yoongi didn’t realise they’d steadily been moving across the room.
with each step taehyung took forward, yoongi took one back.
and when his back hits the edge of a table, taehyung cages him against it, large palms spreading on the wooden surface on either side of yoongi.
"i feel like i've had a bad tooth for years, and i'm finally getting my tongue in there and i’m digging out all the rotten shit."
yoongi goes stiff when taehyung presses their chests together.
his elbow jerks back instinctively and knocks a small potted aloe vera off the narrow ledge of the table, and onto the floor.
but neither of them look away at the sound of the loud crash.
eyes unconsciously following the tongue as it swipes across his lower lip, yoongi watches taehyung wet his lips and feels the air between them gradually change.
it’s subtle, but it’s there.
taehyung’s expensive perfume clouds the air around them, and yoongi’s mouth parts open slightly, taking in deeper breaths to keep his head from growing dizzy from it.
when he glances back to his eyes, he finds taehyung looking back at him.
for two people relentlessly at each other’s throats, they fit together so right.
yoongi’s pale white against taehyung’s golden tan, and taehyung’s larger frame engulfing yoongi’s more slender figure, crowding and pressing his spine against the edge of the table and the cool mirror affixed to the wall behind them.
and at this distance, yoongi can admire the shimmer dusted across the peaks of taehyung’s cheeks, his tan sheen, and the long silver earrings that sway and swing at the slightest movement of his head.
thick and long black locks of hair curl in front of his eyes, and yoongi finds his eyes tracing the sharp slope of his husband’s nose, the mole that sits on the tip of it, and then that deep, gentle descent of his cupid’s bow and another mole below his lower lip.
he can feel taehyung’s eyes on him, watching him as yoongi stares at his glistening mouth, and his head feels light, like one gentle nudge could send him careening towards the hard marble floor.
his alcohol tolerance is much too high for half a glass of whiskey to affect him like this, but he feels like his head is spinning, like his heartbeat is echoing between his temples and his rib cage is shaking with the force of his lungs as he tries to catch his breath when taehyung presses their bodies even closer.
swirls of arousal float thick in the silence between them.
"taehyung," yoongi tests the tenacity of his voice, but it comes out brittle, an unconvincing warning that dissolves into a gasp when taehyung pushes a thigh between yoongi’s legs and presses it against his crotch.
paralysed by taehyung’s proximity, yoongi’s legs fall open on their own, widening his stance until their hips press together, and yoongi has to grip the edge of the narrow table with both hands.
he can’t remember the last time they were intimate, the last time they were this close since the early strands of their marriage.
"look at me."
taehyung’s sharp command yanks yoongi out of his thoughts, and yoongi flinches.
he hesitates.
he’s been staring at taehyung’s lips, his chin, and occasionally the long inviting slope of his throat, but not his eyes, not more than a meagre few seconds.
taehyung obviously knows it, and he doesn’t move until yoongi drags his gaze back to meet his husband’s black unblinking eyes.
it sends a shiver down his spine, and yoongi can feel his hands begin to tremble.
fear and desire and arousal obscure all rational thought in his mind, and when taehyung presses his hip harder against yoongi’s, the drag of the fabric over yoongi’s groin shocks another gasp out of him.
taehyung doesn’t wait.
before yoongi can even conceive the thought to push him away, he’s capturing yoongi’s mouth with his own, knocking their chests together and pushing past his slack lips to taste.
there’s no pretence of gentleness.
it’s rough and desperate, and the extra weight pinning him down has the edge of the table digging painfully into his back, but taehyung pushes his tongue further inside and all thoughts of resistance are lapped up by him.
he tastes of whiskey and a tinge of sweetness from the dessert earlier that has yoongi groaning again.
despite how long it may have been since they last did this, they find their rhythm within seconds.
like there were no years spent in silence, no nights spent in hotel rooms with other conquests, no threats or petty and vindictive attempts to elicit jealousy from the other.
one of yoongi’s hands finds the hair at the nape of taehyung’s neck and grips it tight enough to make taehyung hiss into his mouth.
the kiss breaks, and their mouths are still so close, continuing to breathe in each other’s exhales.
"‘tis what you wanted, right?"
taehyung pants into the air between them.
"flirting with park jimin in front of everybody so i would see you—you just wanted to get me to fuck you, didn’t you?"
yoongi’s eyes slit open; he hadn’t realised when he closed them, and his blurry vision refocuses on taehyung’s dark eyes that look glassy in the yellow lights of their living room, outlined with long lashes and a mole on his waterline.
it takes yoongi a few moments too long to realise taehyung had spoken.
and— "yeah," he says on a harsh exhale.
he’d be lying if he said it didn’t cross his mind.
taehyung’s eyebrow quirks up, caught by surprise at the sudden show of honesty.
it’s subtle, but yoongi’s had years of practice.
he knows where to look.
and it’s so strange, to be so familiar with someone yet so foreign.
taehyung drags his gaze across yoongi’s face, before that mouth finally twists into a devilish smirk, promising cruelty when he coos, "sweetheart," as if in disbelief, not missing the way yoongi’s body jolts against his at the sudden endearment.
"you could’ve just asked."
and when he rolls his hips against yoongi, yoongi’s chin tips up as he groans.
"tae—" he tries, weakly, but taehyung can read yoongi better than possibly everybody else.
and he doesn’t stop.
his hand, that was keeping yoongi caged against the table, now comes to grab him by the back of his neck and tugs him closer to himself.
down to their rawest, with all the surface layers peeled off, yoongi is pliant to taehyung’s every touch and desire.
it is what his husband likes best: to possess what belongs to him, and to fight for it if it doesn’t.
he doesn’t put up a fight when taehyung parts his lips and kisses him greedily, taking possession of every nook and cranny of his wet mouth.
yoongi lets his lips fall slack, and the kiss dissolves into something primal and carnal, their teeth knocking and lips smacking as their tongues tangle and the sounds of their gasps get swallowed in their mouths.
yoongi almost doesn’t notice when taehyung begins to undo the buttons to his leather trench coat, too distracted by the taste of taehyung’s tongue.
the whiskey’s bitterness has vanished completely, along with the cigarettes on yoongi’s tongue, and it’s just the two of them now, tasting vaguely like the lip balm taehyung wears.
taehyung’s hands push the thick coat off his shoulders, revealing the black turtleneck underneath it, and yoongi sheds both the garments before grabbing fistfuls of taehyung’s hair in his hands again.
taehyung growls into his mouth and grabs the waistband of his slacks next.
his movements are harsh as he wrenches the button free and shoves the zipper as far down it would go, before tugging both the trousers and boxers down yoongi’s hips to his thighs.
"turn around," taehyung pulls away from yoongi to grunt, but he doesn’t wait for yoongi to move, grabbing him right away and twisting him around sharply.
yoongi’s fingers scramble to grab the ledge of the narrow table, and he hears taehyung sweep away the pile of clothes between their legs with his boot before he presses his chest to the curve of yoongi’s back—and yoongi catches sight of himself in the mirror.
he doesn’t remember taehyung touching his hair, but the careful blond waves that sat styled in a middle part now hang unruly and sweaty before his eyes.
skin flushed, and his mouth glistening cherry-red in the yellow light, yoongi finds taehyung’s stare in the reflection.
his husband is still fully clothed, and when he places one large palm on the small of yoongi’s back, the cool touch of his rings sends yoongi shivering against taehyung’s broader body.
taehyung presses his palm down on yoongi’s back until yoongi’s spine is curved and his face is so close to the mirror, each of his tremulous breaths fogs up the glass.
"i thought about it too."
taehyung’s voice, that is already a natural honey deep, sounds even lower and rougher now, and yoongi’s head, that still hasn’t stopped spinning, tries to remain steady as a wave of drunk euphoria slowly drowns it, silencing the small voice in his head warning him not to let his lust and residual feelings for taehyung send him back to those times, early in their marriage, when yoongi had foolishly dreamed something would grow between the two of them.
"each time we argued," taehyung keeps his tone blasé, but the dark promise in his eyes, reflected in the mirror, tells a different story, "i wondered if i stuffed your mouth full with my dick, would you still be able to be so mouthy?"
"did you now?"
an incredulous throaty laugh leaves yoongi.
he recognises hopeless daydreams now, knows now that the soil between them is salted beyond repair.
"mm, imagined you sitting docile on your knees while i fucked that pretty mouth full."
taehyung shifts out of his view and bends down to grab something from the floor, and yoongi lets his eyelids fall close.
when his husband returns, he presses a sloppy open mouth kiss to the skin behind yoongi’s ear before whispering into it again, "‘til your throat went raw.
‘til it was filled so full with my cum, you couldn’t speak a word."
there is a distinct sound of taehyung unbuckling his belt, then something soft tearing, and yoongi parts his lips to retort, but a gasp escapes him suddenly when one of taehyung’s hands grabs his ass and spreads it open, something cold and wet dribbling down inside of him a moment later.
his eyes snap open.
"i-is that—?"
"aloe vera."
yoongi watches taehyung toss the broken fleshy leaf somewhere out of his periphery, and feels when he shrugs one shoulder up.
"‘twas ruined already."
the weight on his spine eases, but yoongi remains bent like that, arms strained under his chest and knuckles hard against the rosewood, while taehyung’s finger prods at his wet rim.
his forehead falls against the cool mirror with a quiet thud, moist exhales fogging the mirror and sweat beginning to gather even though they’ve just gotten started.
taehyung pushes his finger until he’s buried up to his knuckle inside yoongi; and the intrusion isn’t pleasant, but the aloe vera makes the slide easier even though taehyung isn’t very gentle himself.
he slips out his finger, and then, without warning, thrusts in two of them inside him, turning and twisting them to coax him open.
"taehyung—fuck, relax," yoongi hisses, gripping the table tight.
"slow down."
"you’re the one who needs to relax," taehyung rasps into his ear.
"so fucking tense," he says and punctuates it by pushing his fingers even deeper inside him.
and yoongi groans at the stretch, back bowing up until taehyung pushes him back down.
his fingers are large, nothing in comparison to his dick, but he still manages to pull out tiny whimpers of pleasure from yoongi as he builds a steady rhythm and fucks him loose with his fingers.
scissoring and spreading them as far as they’d reach, every so often, he’d press against the one spot that has yoongi gasping and panting, fingernails frantically gripping the table tighter.
by the time they get to the third finger—that taehyung, the bastard, thrusts in along with his thick silver wedding ring—yoongi is straining against taehyung’s weight keeping him flush against the table.
hips jolting with every relentless press against his prostate, yoongi whines low in his throat.
"c’mon," he urges through gritted teeth, nearing the end of his patience.
"thought—ah, thought you wanted to shut me up?"
taehyung pauses briefly; then finally abandons all movement, tugging his fingers out of yoongi in one swift pull.
yoongi whines, reflexively, at the loss—a sound that is abruptly strangled in his throat when taehyung snatches his hip and presses the raw uncut head of his cock to his rim.
"you’re right," he says as he curls over him, till they’re pressed against each other completely, taehyung’s chest against yoongi’s back and their lungs heaving in turn.
his husband pants into his ear, "but tonight—for the show you put on for me—i thought maybe, i should fuck you like this."
his grip on yoongi’s hip tightens, like he wants to leave his claim on the thin skin, and it’s the only warning yoongi gets before taehyung is pushing inside him in one steady stroke until he’s buried up to his hilt and yoongi is lifted on his toes to accommodate him.
yoongi’s mouth falls open, but no sound leaves him.
the pressure is uncomfortable, like taehyung’s cock has carved out a new path inside him, remolded yoongi to accommodate his shape and big size, and yoongi’s arms threaten to give out under him, quivering so badly, yoongi knows taehyung feels it too.
he’s proven right when taehyung’s hand leaves his hips and grabs his wrist, yanking it out from under him only to bring it over his head and pin it to the mirror.
he does the same with his other wrist until he has yoongi pinned down under him, on the tips of his toes, belly pressed against the edge of the table and his leaking cock trapped between the two.
head hanging low and precome helplessly trailing down from the slit on his cock, yoongi feels completely confined.
"i’ll take you from behind," taehyung whispers into the nape of his neck, cold nose and hot exhales sweeping against yoongi’s sensitive skin and making him squirm despite taehyung’s hold on him.
taehyung leans down and presses their bodies even closer until yoongi lets out a weak whimper.
"trap you to my bed and fuck you every night ‘til you can’t walk," he says, dreadfully, a threat in his voice that sends a shiver down yoongi’s bent body, "‘til you can’t go out, can’t meet anybody else.
locked in my bedroom, i’d keep you all to myself."
a smile grows on taehyung’s lips, and yoongi feels the thin lips cut sharp against his skin.
"you’d enjoy that, won’t you?
you’ll have all of my attention finally."
yoongi doesn’t get an opportunity to respond because taehyung is immediately pulling out and snapping his hips into him with a strength that punches out a loud strangled moan from yoongi and leaves his jaw slack.
another thrust, and yoongi scrapes his nails against the mirror, wrists still immobile under taehyung’s harsh grip.
"admit it," taehyung pants out, and his fingers tighten so hard around yoongi’s wrists, yoongi hisses.
"you want my attention."
yoongi’s body jostles along with the force of taehyung’s rolls, knees wobbling under him but taehyung’s body pins him upright.
but because he refuses to lose this battle between them, yoongi laughs in between a moan.
"sounds a lot like it’s you who wants my attention," he slurs, lips stretching wide in a smile when he feels taehyung pause briefly in his movements.
"yeah?"
he asks, voice rough, and when yoongi lifts his head, he finds his husband watching him in the mirror.
red lips parted open to take in deeper breaths, yoongi catches a hint of his tongue when it slides across his teeth.
"mm," yoongi answers, and for a long moment, the two of them stare at each other in the mirror wordlessly.
when taehyung resumes his rhythm again, now rolling his hips against yoongi’s ass harder, pace quickening, he bends down to sink his teeth into the back of yoongi’s neck.
it drags a hiss out of yoongi’s lips, and a jolt out of his hips, muscles jumping where the two of them are pressed together intimately.
"so you didn’t have jungkook transferred to your department the next day?"
taehyung says when he resurfaces, sounding more controlled than he appears, saliva on his chin and yoongi’s skin where the indentation of taehyung’s teeth sits fresh and raw.
"the kid had t’ah–lent," yoongi tries to say, but the words dissolve into a series of broken moans when taehyung finally uses that strength in his hips to fuck yoongi at a brutal pace, pelvis slamming down hard against the swell of yoongi’s ass and reaching so deep inside him, yoongi sobs and tries to muffle it into the crook of his elbow.
"you were lettin’ it go to waste—ah—just—becuh-because you wanted to get your dick—uhn—wet fuck—" "and jimin?"
taehyung is relentless, and the sounds of their skin slapping are obscenely loud at this point.
yoongi’s face is wet with his tears.
"were his talents put to good use when he was pounding you into the mattress?"
eyes screwing shut and knees wobbling, his own cock neglected under him, yoongi can only take what taehyung gives him.
and punishment is what taehyung seems to want to give him, with the way his hips pull out almost entirely to his tip before kicking back inside yoongi with a force that has yoongi repeatedly ramming against the table’s edge, prostate hit head-down with every thrust.
yoongi’s mouth falls further open, and he can’t recognise his own voice when he lifts his head and moans, so whiny and desperate.
he shifts his full weight to the table after his knees finally give out under him, and taehyung shifts his hold so he’s holding both of yoongi’s wrists in one hand while the fingers of his other hand slide down to the damp skin of yoongi’s abdomen and dig into his belly possessively, pulling him closer.
"taehyung—" yoongi sobs, tongue heavy and lolling in his mouth.
he’s openly crying now, and he wants to get his hands on his cock, but they remain pinned to the mirror in taehyung’s grip that doesn’t falter even once.
"how small was his dick?"
taehyung rasps in between pants.
"you’re so fucking tight."
it’s only then that yoongi realises, belatedly, that they aren’t using a condom, like fucking fools, like the whole thing wasn’t spurred on by the fact that they had both been sleeping with other people.
"did jimin even fuck you?
you didn’t lie to me about it, right?"
taehyung has his mouth over the side of his face, and he laves his tongue at the soft hairs below his sideburn where his jaw ends, then at the shell of his ear, sloppily sucking at the lobe and tugging at his swinging earrings with his teeth.
"just so i’d fuck you here, like a bitch in heat?"
"i didn’t—i didn’t lie," yoongi insists, then almost whines.
"more, tae—c’mon.
‘tis so good."
"yeah?"
taehyung presses his mouth to yoongi’s ear, his moist exhales blowing right into it.
"better than him, mm?"
moan twisting into an incredulous laugh, yoongi slits his eyes open and twists his neck to stare back at taehyung through the blur of his tears.
"y’are so obvious, you know that?"
he says.
"tell me."
taehyung’s pants are heavy on yoongi’s skin, faces so close, their lips graze, but it’s his black unrelenting gaze on yoongi that has yoongi shivering for all sorts of reasons.
"better, s’much better."
yoongi sighs, voice wrecked and tongue fucked loose.
"you fuck me s’good.
like nobody else.
so deep and rough.
like…" "like what?"
taehyung’s voice is sharp and demanding despite how breathless he sounds, and his painfully tight grip on his wrists almost borders on intolerable.
"like i’m yours."
"like i own you."
"no—like ’m yours," yoongi persists.
there’s a difference, somewhere at the back of his foggy mind, but he can’t bring himself to speak with how taehyung’s balls slap ceaselessly against the back of his thighs, his ass.
taehyung doesn’t refute it, and yoongi whimpers as his orgasm builds wickedly.
he didn’t even realise how close he was until taehyung’s forceful thrusts slowed into something deeper, something more sensual; and then suddenly, it’s too much.
pain and pleasure drag together, and yoongi hears his broken voice cry out.
"tae—taehy’ng, please, please—" he sobs into taehyung’s mouth, and feels slightly delirious when he imagines his stomach bulging out with how deep taehyung’s cock reaches him.
there’s something about being fucked so senseless by taehyung like this, trapped against the mirror on his toes, that has the muscles in his limbs coiling tight and his abdomen clenching inside.
"ah, but you’re seeing park jimin," his husband whispers, as if the thought only just struck him, and he kisses his lip, tugging it between his teeth to expose more of yoongi’s teeth, fingers still holding yoongi’s hands away.
"you want me to call him over?
let him finish you off."
"nn—no—" breaths coming out short, yoongi pleads when taehyung’s hips slow down mercilessly.
"please don’t stop.
want you—please."
"i don’t know if i should believe you," his husband hums, and there’s definitely something cruel there, unrelenting and vicious, a smug curl of his lips.
"please, tae.
i want you," yoongi whimpers, breath hitching as he tries to squirm back against taehyung’s cock inside him, but taehyung pins him down to the table with his hips, allowing no movement.
"please—ah—want your dick—want your big fuckin’ cock."
"want my big cock?"
yoongi nods a few times, frantically, then tips his chin up so they’re panting into each other’s mouths.
"want it s’bad."
"only mine?"
taehyung’s eyes are dark, and fresh tears slide down yoongi’s cheeks.
"only yours," he slurs, more air than voice.
and that seems to satisfy taehyung because he’s abandoning the grip on his wrists and belly immediately in favour of holding him by the hips, keeping him from jostling away by two vice grips before he returns to pounding against him, ramming his thick cock into his abused hole while yoongi cries and claws at the mirror.
with nothing to hold him up, his torso drops forward, limp and fucked-out, and his arms slide back down to his elbows like dead weights, trapped between his chest and the mirror as taehyung jostles their bodies forward.
all he can do is let out weak little whines each time taehyung fucks him even harder, even deeper than before.
his body quivers as his orgasm builds, and yoongi pries his eyes open to his reflection in the fogged mirror: eyes dark and lidded, clumps of wet fluttering eyelashes, and trails of soft dark bruises crawling across his flushed skin—his wrists, his hips, his jaw, throat and his chest—everywhere taehyung’s greedy fingers pressed too hard to profess possession.
tears dry and stiffen against his cheeks; and behind him, taehyung presses his face into the curve of yoongi’s neck and shoulder, no longer able to fuck him with full strokes, but abandoning them in favour of smaller, faster jerks.
"come on my dick," taehyung pants, and punctuates the order by fucking into him with a harsh wet slap.
"you want it so bad?
so come on it."
and as if his body was only waiting for his permission, yoongi’s head tips back against taehyung’s sternum, and he squeezes his eyes shut as the orgasm is slowly dragged out of him in thick spurts of cum that streak up his navel and paint the dark rosewood white.
his gaze goes unfocused as his orgasm climbs, taking his coherency with him as he gasps out taehyung’s name and convulses when taehyung catches him right where it’s overwhelming.
taehyung doesn’t stop though, and yoongi tries to get a palm between them and shove at taehyung’s chest, but it’s of no use.
instead, taehyung pushes at the space between yoongi’s shoulder blades ("stay still," he pants), pressing yoongi’s chest and face against the mirror, and yoongi, despite himself, goes pliantly, back arching high even as his muscles burn at the unnatural pose.
tightening his hold on his hip with the other hand, taehyung tugs yoongi back as he shoves his cock deeper inside him once again, cleaving yoongi open for himself once again.
yoongi’s mouth parts in a sob, body jerking as taehyung fucks him hard and deep and fast.
his sounds are louder and longer now, coming from somewhere deep in his chest as he repeatedly groans out yoongi’s name and rams himself into him, pelvis to ass.
and yoongi falls mute, all noises strangled to silence in his throat even as his mouth hangs open and taehyung pulls him in for a rough and sloppy kiss while he chases his own impending climax.
it is barely even a kiss, taehyung holding his mouth open as he laves at yoongi’s chapped lips, his skin and his sweat.
and yoongi is caught somewhere between the onslaught of his orgasm and the onset of oversensitivity when taehyung finally comes and fills him with his release.
his body unfurls once taehyung eases the pressure on his back, and he slumps down on the table, knees buckling as soon as taehyung lets him go.
heavy pants fill the air, and yoongi feels the wetness trail down inside his thighs.
his entire body leaps up when taehyung pulls out of him, more of his come seeping out and dribbling down yoongi’s legs, who exhales a hiss at the sudden loss.
neither of them speak for a while.
they pant as their breaths even out, and then yoongi hears the sounds of taehyung adjusting the buckle of his belt.
yoongi can’t move though, and he waits until the strength returns to his legs before he staggers upright, wincing at the way his wrists strain to pick his weight.
he expects taehyung to leave once he’s fixed himself, but his husband doesn’t move from his spot behind yoongi, and the two of them watch each other in the mirror in silence while yoongi pulls up and buttons his pants.
taehyung’s dark unblinking gaze makes him uncomfortable, but yoongi rolls his eyes and forgoes his sweater.
he twists around and crosses his arms over his chest, tipping his chin up and meeting taehyung’s eyes head-on even as a shiver threatens to crawl down between his shoulder blades.
they’re too close.
and yoongi swallows hard.
but taehyung is speaking before he can start.
"park jimin," he says, and his expression has returned to its expected impassiveness that tells yoongi nothing.
yoongi feels like he’s being cornered again, and he has to physically stop himself from flinching when taehyung steps forward and leans close enough for their noses to brush.
his lips part instinctively, but nothing comes out besides a shaky exhale.
taehyung breathes with him, and the hot air is mixed with a prick of dread that nips at yoongi’s skin where taehyung’s exhales meet his lips.
"you don’t actually think he wants you, do you?"
taehyung’s voice is low.
and yoongi’s heartbeat spikes when taehyung’s hand comes to grab his chin.
trapping it between his thumb and a curled knuckle, his husband continues, "he’s just using you to get at me."
yoongi sets his jaw tight and says nothing.
taehyung watches him with lidded dark eyes.
the lights cast a shadow across his face, making his handsome features look sharper and more pronounced, and at this distance, yoongi has to tilt up his head to look at him, at the strong line of his nose, his jaw, the adam’s apple— taehyung’s grip on his chin tightens, jerking it up to force yoongi to meet his eyes.
they’re burning black.
"but you probably already know that."
taehyung’s voice is flat, his lips moving slowly and his eyes deliberately dragging across yoongi’s face till they stop at his lips.
"after all," taehyung unhooks his knuckle and slides it along the edge of his jaw, joining more fingers to hold him there—and then he grins, a corner of his lips pulled to the side to reveal a row of teeth.
sharp and predatory, he tilts his face closer to yoongi’s and whispers against his lips with purpose, "you’d spread your legs for anybody who offers you even a morsel of attention."
ice chills yoongi down to his core.
taehyung pulls away, just a little, and for a moment, yoongi just stands there stiff, staring at the way taehyung’s eyelashes flutter against his cheekbones and thin wavy strands of his hair hang before his eyes.
a pleased smirk carved between his lips and— a loud, visceral laugh leaves yoongi's chest.
it scrapes painfully against his raw throat, and taehyung jerks his head back to look at him with surprise.
"if that’s the case," yoongi starts, lips twitching into a smirk before he’s smiling wide and menacing as he curls his fingers around taehyung’s wrist and wrenches it away from his face.
"what about you?"
taehyung takes a grudging half-step back, but yoongi is closing the distance between them once again.
"if park jimin is flirting with me to get a reaction out of you—" enunciating each word with a slow mocking precision, yoongi takes another step forward, still smiling when he cocks his head slightly to the side and asks, "aren’t you doing just that?"
fury flashes across taehyung’s face, a storm seething in his eyes, and yoongi laughs again.
"so easy," he taunts.
"he knows exactly how to play you."
and because all that between taehyung and jimin comes down to just one thing: "the chairman probably knows it too.
that’s why he gave the position to park jimin."
smiling sweetly in the face of taehyung’s rage, yoongi leans forward to hammer in the final nail.
"he couldn’t entrust the company to his imbecile son now, could he?"
even if just for a fraction of a moment, he sees a flash of taehyung’s teeth where his lips curl up in a feral snarl, and then yoongi is being slammed back against the table by two large palms.
his shoulder is pushed into the wall hard, and yoongi lets out a loud broken scream when a sharp pain cuts into the back of his scalp where his head is smashed into the mirror.
the hands on his shoulders jerk away abruptly, and yoongi feels the ground slide out from under him as his body crumples and his knees tremble, then give out as well.
he slides down the leg of the table as a heavy sinking feeling settles over him and his eyes droop close.
consciousness quickly receding into the far corners of his mind, yoongi grows vaguely aware of the wetness growing at the back of his head and trickling down to his neck.
he struggles to sit upright, but sourness comes rushing up to his throat and he can barely lift his head.
it is only the unbearable throbbing pain at the back of his skull that keeps him from blacking out and collapsing on the hard marble floor; and even though he can't understand what he's saying, distantly, yoongi can make out taehyung’s panicked voice from somewhere above him.
when he finally, slowly lifts the weight of his eyelids and turns his head to face him, eyes glazed and unfocused, he sees his husband crouched on his knees in front of him, frightened hands hovering in the air above yoongi as if not knowing if or where he should touch him.
yoongi blinks several times to clear his vision.
the floor under his palms is damp and sticky.
it takes a lot of effort, but yoongi digs his fingers into the floor and, eventually, gathers enough strength to move.
he lifts himself on his elbow, shoulders trembling, as he shifts and puts the weight onto his forearm to twist his torso until he’s oriented upright.
the simple movement leaves him breathless, nausea and agony flaring up so hot in his skull, he thinks it’ll burst open.
but yoongi grits his teeth and swallows down the pained cry before it leaves him, attention snatched by taehyung who has his phone in his frantic hands, fingers no doubt dialling for the ambulance.
his body is in no shape to move, but yoongi is clenching his teeth tight and jerking to the side anyway, arm shooting out and grabbing the phone from taehyung’s fingers only to hurl it at the wall to their right.
the phone is smashed by the sudden impact with the wall before it falls on the floor, and taehyung’s head jerks up to look at him.
then, as if all his earlier qualms about touching yoongi suddenly dissipate in an instant, taehyung is crawling closer to him, and yoongi’s hand immediately pats the floor behind him blindly to find a weapon big enough.
"what in the hell are you—" taehyung starts to hiss, but whatever he was about to say gets dissolved in a gasp as soon as he is close enough for yoongi to stab his side with the large piece of glass fisted in his fingers.
taehyung stills momentarily, presumably out of shock, and yoongi digs the piece of glass deeper into flesh till he can be sure that he’s slashed at his kidney and taehyung’s mouth falls open as he struggles to breathe.
arms shaking until he ultimately falls onto his elbows and his forehead collides against yoongi’s sternum, taehyung's body sags down and his stomach shudders uncontrollably against the jut of yoongi’s hip bones.
hot tears slide down yoongi’s cheeks, and his head throbs painfully, breaths coming faster and sharper in his throat.
years and years of accumulated endurance, and his stomach still threatens to convulse at the thought and the sight of it all coming to an end.
but remorse is no longer a choice, and he's prying out the glass before thrusting it in deeper, till his entire fist is sunk and smeared in taehyung's blood.
and taehyung is wheezing, a pained cry breaking through his lips and echoing strangely in his mouth.
his body jerks and twitches involuntarily, but he can hardly move or breathe, bleeding so heavily it’s drenched his entire side and soaked yoongi up till his elbow, a pool of it rapidly growing under their bodies like a red flat lake.
drenched in blood, sweat, tears and cum, left shoulder grinding against the edge of the table’s leg and scalp cut open and bleeding down his neck, when two of taehyung’s hands come to grab him in one last desperate attempt to thrash yoongi off him, yoongi can’t stop him.
his heart spasms in his chest, a frantic rhythm against his rib cage that pounds heavily against his skull as well.
but taehyung only manages to lift himself by a fraction before he slams back down again, body too weak to carry its own weight.
his chest won’t lift to let his lungs expand.
and for a long time, there’s nothing besides a heavy silence that stretches over their heads like death.
then yoongi grabs taehyung’s hair and yanks it back so violently, his head is thrown as far back as it can without his neck splitting.
and staring deep into his lifeless eyes, flat and black, yoongi tries to find even the faintest flicker of life but comes up empty.
he is dead.
strangely, the thought doesn’t unsettle him, and he lets the head fall back against his chest where it meets his sternum with a heavy thump.
yoongi doesn’t know how long he lies there, unmoving, with taehyung on top of him.
soaking wet in the steady stream of his husband’s blood, yoongi runs his fingers through taehyung’s thick hair and stares up at the ceiling as he breathes: in, till his lungs grow so full his ribs ache, then back out slowly.
like, for the first time, despite his husband’s dead weight threatening to crush his chest, it’s the easiest thing in the world.
yoongi wakes up to the persistent saltiness on his tongue and a dry, brackish throat that gasps for air for a few panicked seconds where his limbs, jammed stiff in sleep, flail out in blind helplessness, searching for something—anything—until he feels cold hands hold his palms and press them against a sturdy chest, strong and steady and familiar.
taehyung’s low honeyed voice brings him back, and yoongi instinctively follows his counts and feels his lungs expand with air, "slowly, now exhale, with me, that’s right."
the terror slowly seeps out of his stiff body even as the darkness remains.
it’s okay, everything’s alright, taehyung whispers close to his ear, and yoongi shakily pushes himself off the floor with taehyung’s help, feeling for the boat’s gunwale and settling his torso against it so that the sun’s warmth hits the side of his face.
he guesses it’s well into morning.
"it’s half past ten," taehyung affirms his thoughts, and from the sounds of the tin cans clinking together, yoongi can tell that he’s counting their quickly depleting supplies and calculating their duration.
ten packs of biscuits, and twenty one cans of fresh water, yoongi’s mental repository reminds him.
unless it rains again, their supplies won’t last them longer than a week.
when his breathing returns to normal, yoongi twists around and maneuvers his way across the boat.
skimming his fingers along the edge of the boat, he familiarises himself with the vessel once again even though it’s hardly necessary at this point.
he knows the boat like he knows his bedroom back in seoul, but it gives him something to do.
just like taehyung likes to count and organise their supplies each day, yoongi likes to check their equipment and make sure everything is working like it should.
it provides him an illusion of a routine, something to keep him busy and not fall into the waves of despair that threaten to drown him each time he lets his mind wander into the darkness.
two buoyant oars.
about four meters in length and held in place by thole pins.
they’d attempted rowing the boat on their first day, steering it in a direction that had made sense at the time.
but after five hours of battling the currents under the harsh sun, halfway into their day, hands chafed red and arms throbbing with ache, it became evident that it was doing little for them and that conserving their body’s strength and energy should be the higher priority.
two boat hooks, left unleashed and ready for use to fend away from the ship’s side.
taehyung and yoongi had gotten more use out of them by using them as swords in some unnecessarily elaborate historical roleplay that taehyung had began impromptu on their first night under the stars.
one boat bailer and two buckets of a carrying capacity of two gallons, the first of which they use for storing freshwater.
the second bucket is the one taehyung peed in, and it’s kept on the stern end of the boat.
taehyung likes to annoy yoongi by pretending he accidentally switched the two.
a survival manual kept on the side bench, arguably the most useful item they found in their locker.
fortunately, it has an english translation below the original japanese text.
unfortunately, it doesn’t come in braille.
taehyung reads it out loud each day for both of their benefit.
two hatchets, stowed at each end of the boat.
they’ve only used them to chop the heads off the thrashing fish they catch in their net.
understandably, only taehyung gets to wield it.
a jack knife attached to the boat by a metal lanyard, used mostly to open tin cans and divide their catch into equal portions.
one sea anchor with shock resistant hawser and a tripping line.
waves are more strongly felt when the boat turns sideways to the current.
the sea anchor keeps the boat’s head to the wind, increasing control and reducing sea sickness.
two rescue quoit, one 20 meters long painter rope, a daylight signalling mirror, and a radar reflector.
they haven’t found a need for any of those yet.
four rocket parachute flares, six hand flares, and two buoyant smoke floats—they all proved to be equally useless as well.
taehyung had screamed his throat raw when he caught a glimpse of a passing freighter in the distance two days ago.
the two of them had launched flares, yelled, and banged the buckets against the side of the boat, but the vessel simply passed them silently.
the days since then have been unimaginably longer.
inside the small gear locker, there is a pack of anti-seasickness tablets, of which only two remain.
taehyung had spent the better half of the second day bent over the gunwale until yoongi found the sea anchor in the locker.
there is a watertight container that yoongi recognises as the first-aid kit.
along with it are two thermal protective aids, a searchlight, an electric torch, and portable fire extinguishing equipment.
the entire boat is twenty six feet long and eight feet wide, partially covered with a tarpaulin on the stern end where taehyung sits.
yoongi hears him close the storage compartment where they keep the food supplies, and bring out a packet of crackers.
"we still have the dorado from last night.
you want to have that?"
yoongi clicks his tongue in response, and once again, using the gunwale as a guide, he makes his way to taehyung who holds his hand when he reaches him.
taking the packet of crackers from taehyung, yoongi sits on the bench and pulls the wrapping open.
next to him, he hears taehyung bring out the leftovers of the dried fish they caught yesterday.
it had taken a while for them to get any good at it.
there had been a set of fishing tackle amongst the food rations, but even though yoongi had tagged along with seokjin on sufficient fishing expeditions to know what he had to do, doing it blind, in the middle of the pacific, and with no bait, had proved to require an entirely separate skill set.
it has been difficult, the blindness, even though it’s been almost seven months since the horrid darkness sunk behind his pupils permanently.
seven months since the last day of the previous year, when the bridge on their way home from jimin and hoseok’s place had iced over.
vehicles were sliding, and the bus from the opposite lane was speedily careening towards them.
yoongi, who was behind the wheel at the time, had had only a split of a second to react.
he’d swerved their car to the left, towards the guardrail, and it could've been fine.
it would’ve been fine if the bus hadn’t crashed straight into the guardrail as well, the impact of it breaking the barricade beyond the guardrail and plunging their car into the freezing water below the bridge.
now, taehyung carries a long scar across his chest, and yoongi lives in an inescapable darkness.
funny how that works out, because just seven months later, they’re now stranded on a blue desert after a shipwreck.
this was supposed to be an anniversary vacation to hawaii.
taehyung had been planning the trip for months, as a break from what their lives had become (relentless arguments and fights over taehyung wanting to help, desperately, and yoongi fiercely refusing to be treated like an invalid) a time to start afresh, and the thought alone makes yoongi want to laugh out loud and cry until his chest hurts.
they eat their breakfast quietly.
in the beginning, taehyung had attempted to fill up the silences; now the two of them remain silent as they eat, and it’s only when yoongi finishes eating does taehyung talk.
"yoongi," he says casually, honorifics lost sometime during the past three years of marriage, after he discovered the way yoongi shivered against him when taehyung whispered yoongi-yah into his ear and gently rocked inside him.
"do you want to shave today?"
life after the accident was much different.
while yoongi had slowly grown accustomed to living with his handicap, both at home and at work, there were some aspects of his blindness that he had stubbornly refused to let taehyung into.
this was one of them.
yoongi had refused to let taehyung help him early on, still furious at his own helplessness.
for weeks, he tried to do it himself, and while he had a steady hand and never nicked his skin, there always remained patches that eyesight alone could have spotted.
now, yoongi sits under the shade of their rainwater catcher as taehyung kneels between his thighs, his fingers keeping yoongi’s chin in place as he wipes yoongi’s face with a damp cloth.
"that better be from the right bucket," yoongi says absently, too rigid and focused on the intimacy of taehyung’s gentle touches as his husband smoothes the cool shaving cream over his face, across his jaw, on his cheeks, and above and below his lips "oh no," taehyung drawls dryly, voice devoid of all inflection and his face close enough for yoongi to feel his exhales against his face.
"i am shaving my husband’s face with my piss."
yoongi almost snorts out loud before he schools his face and rolls his eyes.
for some bizarre reason, out of all possible things, taehyung’s bag of toiletries had made its way onto their lifeboat.
most of the items in it were useless, hairsprays and face packs that taehyung had packed for the trip.
but some of them had proven to be essential, like the sunscreen and moisturizer and apparently the shaving kit now.
never in his life did yoongi ever imagine taehyung would be shaving his face in the middle of the pacific ocean while sharks and jellyfish swam under their boat.
their survival manual had instructed them to build a routine to bring some normalcy to their lives, to keep themselves busy by doing things that required little exertion.
and most of their days are spent on little mundane things like cleaning their boat and its equipment, distilling seawater in solar stills, fishing for dinner, keeping watch for land or rescuers, singing, and competing to see who could come up with the worst puns.
at night, they would lie down and face the sky, and taehyung would guide yoongi’s outstretched arm to point at stars and constellations as he told the stories behind their names.
he had a way of telling stories that made them funny and entertaining, and made yoongi feel like he probably wouldn’t mind staying like that forever, afloat in the middle of the black ocean with no anchor but taehyung’s hand to hold onto.
taehyung tilts yoongi’s head to the side with a firm but tender force before he places the razor on the swell of his cheek and shaves the stubble that had grown there.
he works silently, and for a long time, it’s just the sound of the wind whipping against the canvas of the rainwater catcher, the slide of the blade against yoongi’s skin, and the occasional splash of water as the razor is dipped into the bucket.
after all these years, taehyung’s proximity still makes yoongi stiff.
even with vision, a non-verbal taehyung used to make him anxious.
now, with no way of knowing what expression taehyung is wearing, the silence and proximity makes yoongi swallow hard in his constricted throat.
when he finishes, taehyung cleans yoongi’s face with a cool, soft cloth.
yoongi expects him to pull away, but for a long strained moment, taehyung remains where he is, kneeling between yoongi’s thighs and his soft exhales fanning against yoongi’s damp cheeks.
"you know," taehyung starts, voice low and tight and close, and yoongi can tell that he’s being cautious with his words, like he knows he’s going to say something yoongi might not like.
a sensation sizzles down yoongi’s spine when taehyung’s fingers gently come to caress his jaw.
"your eyes, they’re still brown."
all air escapes yoongi, and his mouth parts open, throat constricting wetly.
he doesn’t know what expression his face is wearing, but the impact must’ve shown on it because both of taehyung’s hands come to hold his face, cupping it between them, and yoongi suddenly feels so transparent.
"yoongi-yah," taehyung says so lovingly, and yoongi only feels his tears when they slide down his cheeks.
in the hospital, words like ‘traumatic optic neuropathy’ and ‘functional optical cells’ and 'uninhibited neural pathways' had been tossed around, but yoongi had not cared about them when all they translated into was a cemented blackness behind his pupils.
appearances do not matter to the blind, but the accident had flipped his entire world upside down, and to know that his eyes–his useless, fucking eyes—look no different than before, when it feels like almost all of yoongi is a different person now.
taehyung’s thumbs wipe the wetness from his face, and yoongi protests when his husband pulls him forward into an embrace.
it is of no use.
taehyung is stronger and more stubborn than him, and when yoongi falls into his lap, taehyung’s arms wrap around his waist, much too close for yoongi’s comfort.
he feels seen, and it’s so cruelly unfair because yoongi cannot see him at all.
"you’re beautiful," taehyung tells him, his voice steady with a determination that tells yoongi he’ll fight him if yoongi makes even a sound of disagreement.
yoongi doesn’t know how to respond to it.
in the past few months, taehyung has taken to openly declaring these kinds of things, not that he didn’t do it before, but he does it even more now.
and yoongi still hasn’t grown accustomed to it.
partly because it doesn’t feel honest.
"you don’t believe me," taehyung says when yoongi remains quiet.
"you think i’m lying?"
he does.
but yoongi really doesn’t want to go through this.
he doesn’t have the energy for it.
"taehyung, it’s fine—" he starts tiredly.
"no, it isn’t," taehyung cuts him off, and yoongi presses his lips into a firm line.
this is heading towards a very familiar family of arguments where taehyung is stubbornly, desperately, full of love, and yoongi is full of thorns and scalding truths.
"seeing you like this hurts me," taehyung continues softly, "i wish you would see yourself the way i do."
"you wish i would see myself the way you do," yoongi repeats, deadpan.
"you know what i mean."
he doesn’t.
there are seawater boils threatening to burst out of the skin on his wrists and forearms.
his face is sunburnt and dirty.
his shirt hangs over his bony frame, torn at three different places, and his pants are stuck to the dried blood on his knee where he’d scraped it on the night of the wreck.
the stench of fish and salt clings to him persistently, and yoongi can't think of a single part of him that feels worthy of taehyung’s words.
"i don’t," he says honestly, a little irritated that taehyung won’t drop it.
"i don’t understand why you insist on doing this."
for a long moment, there is no reply from taehyung’s end, and just when yoongi suspects that his husband will finally drop it, taehyung straightens and pulls yoongi closer to him.
"okay, so here’s what we’re going to do.
we’re going to sit here—" taehyung holds yoongi tighter against him for emphasis, like he thinks yoongi will fight him, "and i’m going to tell you all the things i love and admire about you, and you can tell me what hangups you have about them, and then together, we can dissect those."
"do i even get a choice in this matter?"
yoongi is exhausted, but is also very well acquainted with a taehyung on a mission and knows how little protesting helps.
"nope."
yoongi doesn’t need to see him to know the smug smile taehyung is wearing.
"i’m going to prove to you how stupid you are."
"doesn’t that go against like, the whole integrity of this exercise?"
"no.
you’re incredibly smart most of the time, but you’re being excessively stupid right now.
hence, the intervention."
yoongi rolls his eyes, but doesn’t interrupt.
"okay, i’ll start simply.
hyung, you’re beautiful.
your eyes, your nose, your lips, cheeks, everything.
all of you is beautiful, and i could honestly kiss you for hours.
if you fight me on this, i am not kidding, i will toss you to the sharks."
yoongi grits his teeth.
he feels taehyung’s eyes bore holes into the front of his face, and for a moment, he wants to resist, be recalcitrant about the whole thing.
it feels absurd.
the past two weeks have been absurd, and yoongi feels like he’s lost a little of his mind already.
part of him doesn’t want to do this at all because he doesn’t want to fight with taehyung, because he’s certain that that is what will happen if they talk about feelings, but part of him is also so close to giving up altogether.
they’re stranded in the middle of the pacific ocean, and yoongi doesn’t know how long they can keep up this sense of normalcy.
each night, he carves a line onto the back of the boat, one line for each day that they survive, and there are fifteen of them already.
his hope has steadily been waning, and fuck if taehyung wants to talk about feelings, then fine, they’ll talk about feelings.
"it’s—" he starts and clenches his teeth.
yoongi is the kind who will dissect and pick apart things inside his head for days.
he’s good at introspection, but between the two of them, taehyung is the one more comfortable with verbal expressions of his emotions.
"you tell me nice things, and i believe you.
i know you aren’t lying.
but it doesn’t feel real to me.
it doesn’t fit the reality i know."
"why doesn’t it feel real?"
the truth is, yoongi knows and believes taehyung’s sincerity.
he doesn’t doubt that, never did.
he knows that taehyung truly cherishes him.
that all of the bitterness that festers inside yoongi’s lungs is rooted in his own insecurities and misgivings.
but even knowing that doesn’t rid him of them.
"it’s more than my appearance," yoongi gets out, "it’s–" it’s the persistent gnawing awareness at the back of his head.
the reminder of their diminishing supplies.
of the fact that his mere existence is making things difficult for taehyung right now.
where the supplies would last taehyung alone another two weeks, because of yoongi, they’d only last him a week more at most.
taehyung pretends to go to sleep around the same time as yoongi, but yoongi knows that he lies.
that he stays up longer and wakes up earlier to keep a lookout for predators or rescuers or land.
yoongi is entirely useless in that regard.
he can’t even tell day from night.
taehyung is the one who catches fish for the both of them.
he’s the one forcing cheer and hope into both of them.
and perhaps, the hardest part of it all is knowing that what is keeping yoongi alive is also killing taehyung.
that his husband would live longer if yoongi was dead.
yoongi is a deadweight to taehyung at best.
"i don’t feel beautiful.
i feel fucking useless," he grits out, and before taehyung can interrupt him, yoongi goes on, "i know you don’t think that i’m a burden, but be honest, it’s true.
i need help with the most basic of things, like this—" yoongi gestures towards his face wildly.
"there’s nothing attractive about a grown-ass man needing to be babysat.
and there’s no way that i could’ve survived this on my own—" "and you think i could?"
taehyung snaps, anger brimming under his words.
"you don’t honestly think that i could’ve lived through the past weeks by myself, do you?"
yoongi doesn’t reply.
he hears taehyung take a steadying breath.
"hyung," taehyung says, "the only reason i was able to get through these days was because i had you with me.
you’re the reason i don’t give up hope.
i can’t give it up.
and i don’t think that relying on somebody makes you any lesser of yourself.
i won’t invalidate your struggle.
i know it’s difficult.
which actually brings me to the second thing i wanted to say."
taehyung leans forward and rests his head on yoongi’s shoulder, twisting it so yoongi feels his words directly against his ear.
"yoongi, you’re the strongest person i know."
when taehyung feels yoongi struggle against his hold, he tightens his arms around yoongi’s torso till the whistle dangling from taehyung’s neck digs painfully against yoongi’s clavicle.
"it’s true.
you refuse to acknowledge it, but i won’t.
you think i don’t notice how much you struggled to reopen your legal practice?
you think none of our friends see it?
you’re fiercely independent, and i know how much you hate having me help you with things like this, but i wish you’d realise that it doesn’t make me think any less of you.
before everything else, i wish you’d stop thinking that you have to prove yourself worthy of my affection.
that you have to prove yourself worthy of your own affection and respect.
it kills me when you put yourself down like this."
dimly, yoongi is aware of the streaks of wetness trailing down his face, and he doesn’t resist when taehyung pulls back and shifts so he can lean in.
yoongi instinctively closes his eyes when he feels taehyung’s lips press against his own.
"i love you," taehyung whispers when they part, noses still touching.
"i loved you before as you were, and i love you as you are now.
i will love you always, and it’s best you get that inside your skull soon, min yoongi, because once we get out of here, i’m going to be romancing the hell out of my husband of three years whether he likes it or not."
that pulls a wet laugh out of yoongi, and he feels taehyung smile against his lips as well.
he doesn’t know how to express himself with words, he’s had quite enough of them already, so he pulls taehyung into another kiss, and taehyung readily complies.
he holds yoongi tight in his arms, leaving no room for the anger in yoongi’s chest.
it’s okay, everything’s going to be okay, he promises into their kiss.
and enfolded in the tender cradle of taehyung’s body, yoongi chooses to believe him.
yoongi should be surprised when he spots a dark figure leaning against the corner of the dimly-lit secluded street, but yoongi is tired.
he is tired and he can’t bring himself to care when namjoon silently treads after him after yoongi deliberately walks past him, ignoring his presence until namjoon coughs into his hand and draws yoongi’s attention away from the lock he’s struggling with.
if namjoon sees the way yoongi’s fingers can’t seem to open the door to his house because of the tremors that rarely leave him these days, he doesn’t comment on it.
instead, he drops the cigarette he’d been chewing on, crushing it under the heel of his boot.
and yoongi eyes him with a mix of exhaustion and irritation.
he doesn’t know what namjoon wants from him, but he already knows that he wants no part in it.
he wants to be left alone, wants his hands to stop fucking shaking so he can get the damn door to open and slam it shut in namjoon’s face.
but namjoon must read his thoughts because he takes a step forward, coming close enough for his shadow to engulf yoongi, and it’s probably the first time yoongi has ever gotten a good look at his face.
they’ve never been close, only barely even classifying as acquaintances, yet namjoon looms over him, so close that yoongi has to lift his chin to meet his eyes, and he can’t trample down the instinctive twinge of fear he feels fast enough.
"yoongi," namjoon says lowly even though they’re the only two people on this damned street.
but they both know better than to believe that.
"you haven’t been sleeping," he says as if he’s making a revolutionary fucking observation.
yoongi’s lip stiffly curls at the corner.
"brilliant deduction, doctor," he says dryly, looking away from namjoon's knowing eyes and shaking the lock until it finally falls away, "now if you’re done with the health check-up, you can very kindly fuck off."
he very much intends to walk past the tall man into the darkness of his home, but namjoon grabs him by the shoulder and yoongi stills.
"i do not intend to cross you, yoongi.
and i can tell when my presence is not welcome, but i won’t take much of your time.
i only came here to deliver something to you."
yoongi eyes him warily while namjoon pulls out what looks like an envelope from the breast pocket of his trench coat.
"i was instructed to hand this to you.
taehyung gave it to me a few days before he..."
namjoon’s lips stiffen at the corner and his deliberate silence doesn’t need to be filled.
the words hang heavy in the air, and this time it’s impossible to miss the way yoongi’s hand shakes when he pulls the envelope from namjoon’s fingers.
it’s unexpectedly thick, but yoongi isn’t surprised.
his husband was quite the talker, and yoongi can only imagine what he’s written to him.
he has dozens of his letters from back when yoongi was still a cadet and taehyung the wide-eyed assistant of a train conductor.
despite his boyish naivety, taehyung had a charm to him.
he used to smile a lot more then, grinned so foolishly each time he saw yoongi, it made yoongi’s heart melt a little in his chest.
he always had so much to say, yoongi figured he’d been told to shut up quite often when he was a kid, but yoongi found it charming, felt his bastard of a heart betray him each time taehyung brought yoongi’s knuckles to his lips and pretended he was some dazzling prince.
"i’ll leave you with it," namjoon’s voice jolts yoongi out of his thoughts, and he looks up at the doctor whose eyes feel more intrusive than he’d like.
yoongi’s never been fond of the man, granted he never liked most of taehyung’s "friends," but there’s always been something especially peculiar about namjoon.
nothing necessarily malicious, but something clinical, an academic curiosity that travelled beyond what yoongi would consider humane.
"thank you," yoongi murmurs, grateful despite his reservations.
he’s already clutching the letter tightly in his fingers; taehyung’s last words to him, yoongi wonders what they’d be.
a love letter?
a warm note of his sincere affection?
their late days weren’t as full of that as yoongi now wishes they’d been.
they loved each other, there wasn’t a sliver of doubt about that in yoongi’s mind, but they argued relentlessly regardless.
their ideologies, their beliefs, they clashed too often, and despite both of them wanting the best for each other, they still found themselves engaged in screaming matches for days on end.
if yoongi knew things would end the way they did, so abruptly and cruelly, he wonders what he’d have done.
if he had a chance to speak to taehyung again, what would he have said?
what would taehyung say to him?
yoongi will find out soon enough.
namjoon’s hand squeezes yoongi’s shoulder as if in reassurance, but yoongi’s bones feel hollow.
even the littlest of forces feels like it would crush them to splinters.
"if you want to seek us, you know where to find us," namjoon murmurs, voice dipping low, and yoongi finds himself nodding briefly even though he doubts it.
"i know we aren’t close, but taehyung means a lot to all of us too.
if anyone understands your pain right now, it’s us."
yoongi would laugh at his fucking face, but he simply shrugs namjoon’s hand off his shoulder.
he’s tired and his throat is closing in painfully tight painfully quickly.
"if you’ll excuse me now," he whispers, voice thicker than he wants it to be.
"of course."
namjoon dips his head in lieu of a goodbye.
when yoongi slips inside his house and slams the door shut behind him, his knees finally give away.
he slides down the door, letter clutched in his fingers and his forehead pressed against his knees, the first sob of the night escaping his throat and echoing in the empty house.
an hour later, yoongi sits cross-legged in front of the fireplace, a bundle of what appears to be approximately forty lined white pages trapped together by a clip on the top left corner, all filled from top to bottom in taehyung’s familiar penmanship.
the letters slope forward, and yoongi is reminded of an inane memory of taehyung being convinced that a man's handwriting is the teller of his personality.
he feels his lips stretching into an involuntary smile despite himself and finally places his glasses on his nose as he holds the papers lower so the light from the fire illuminates its writing.
squeezing his eyes shut, he allows himself one shaky breath before he pulls them open and begins to read: min yoongi, the love of my life, i have been preparing to write this letter to you for days, but now that i am, i am so impossibly terrified.
you must be confused, no there’s no doubt about it.
this letter will be delivered to you a week after my passing, and i cannot imagine what the past few days must have been like.
i wish i could take it all from you, love.
i wish there was something i could do, to lessen your ache even by a fraction, and to know that i’m the reason for it all— yoongi grips the paper harder.
the next few words are illegible, the ink smudged no doubt from taehyung’s own tears, and yoongi grazes his thumb across the wrinkled paper, feeling his chest tighten with a familiar ache.
he swallows down the lump in his tight throat and reads on.
i wish i could apologise, but i do not even deserve that.
i don’t deserve to ask for your forgiveness.
but i do request that you hear me out, that you read what i am about to tell you very carefully.
as we both knew already, i was going to die.
we never spoke of it, but merely closing our eyes and sealing our mouths shut does not make the truth disappear.
it was inevitable.
we both knew it.
when i lost my legs and was trapped to this bed, it felt like i’d already died my first death.
namjoon visited me on one such afternoon.
you used to insist on staying with me, but i always pushed you away.
we fought so much, and you never once raised your voice at me.
i felt like a child.
you fed me, clothed me, helped me wash myself, and i’ve never despised myself so much.
you never lost your patience yet i continued to grow bitter.
i pushed you away because i could not see you wasting your life on me.
i felt like a burden was lonely.
i am lonely.
i am lonely and tired, and this body, it no longer makes me feel alive.
i am wasting away, and looking at you spending all that energy, all that love on something like me—i say a thing because i no longer feel like a person—i have never hated anything more in my life.
please do not misunderstand my intent, i am not writing this to inflict guilt upon you.
i would never wish for such a thing.
i merely need you to understand my state of mind at the time to make you understand why i did what i did.
namjoon visited me, and he had this look on his face.
i knew he’d come to me with a proposal, and he wasn’t certain how i’d receive it.
i was proven true when after some idle chit-chat, namjoon tried to casually ease into what was the true purpose behind his visit.
i say tried, but he was so obvious about it.
anyway, he began to tell me about a doctor’s journal he’d managed to get his hands on a few months ago.
"it is quite gruesome," he began, and coming from namjoon, i had to believe that it was.
"the doctor is dead now i believe.
but that isn’t significant.
it is his journal that is fascinating.
he writes about an experiment where the head of a dog is completely severed from its body, but its blood supply is being maintained through the arteries and veins by means of an artificial heart.
and here this: the dog’s head remains alive.
its brain remains capable of functioning.
the doctor proved it by running several tests, like when food was smeared across the dog’s lips, its tongue would come out and lick it away.
its eyes would follow the people around in the room.
it was alive."
"it was alive," i echoed, and i could gather a vague picture of what was being proposed to me.
"it seems reasonable to conclude that the head and the brain do not need to be attached to the rest of the body to remain alive provided, of course, that a supply of properly oxygenated blood is maintained."
namjoon then dragged a chair beside my bed and seated himself on it.
at this distance, i could see the way his eyes gleamed with glee.
"now, after reading that, the obvious question in my mind was to know whether removing the brain from the skull of a human and keeping it alive and functioning as an independent unit for an unlimited period of time was possible."
i didn’t like it.
i didn’t like the growing excitement in namjoon’s voice.
i didn’t like the way he leaned over me as if he was sharing a wondrous discovery while i was feeling quite ill at the thought of it.
"i’ve been working on it quietly for the past few months.
a couple of others have been helping me out, but we’ve all kept quiet about it.
the doctor provided instructions on how to build this machine that supplies the blood to the brain, and we’ve completed a number of successful trials with animals, but i believe we’re ready now to operate on a human.
from the surgical point of view, it doesn’t seem to me why it should be any more or less practicable."
namjoon grew silent after that.
it was as if he was expecting me to jump at his thinly veiled proposition, but i did no such thing of course.
namjoon sighed then, and suddenly he looked a lot more somber than he had the entire evening.
"you’re going to die," he said to me.
the first time somebody had spoken it out loud.
"i’ve seen cases like this before.
this illness, it’s going to spread across your entire body.
it’s taken your legs but it’s not done yet.
it’s going to grow, and it’s going to consume all of you unless you do something about it.
unless you let me do something about it."
i watched him silently.
he was right.
i was going to die.
nobody could contest that.
"have you considered," i started, "that i would, in fact, not be alive after you’ve performed whatever it is you say you wish to perform on me?"
"why would you say that?"
"you say you’d keep my brain wet with blood, but would i be alive?"
namjoon’s eyebrows crinkled with confusion.
he was a man of science so i didn’t expect him to understand right away.
"is all our life contingent on the existence of our brain?
are we purely physical beings?
have you considered our death is not merely the death of our physical bodies, but something non-physical as well?"
that cleared namjoon’s confusion.
"you mean, like, souls?
i never pegged you for somebody who believes in that sort of stuff."
"i don't," i huffed out, "or well i didn’t, not in any manner serious enough.
but you reach close enough to the doors of death like i have, and you too would start to wonder about all kinds of strange things."
"alright, that's fair.
i understand your reservations.
we can talk through this.
tell me, what reason do you have to posit the existence of souls?
or any immaterial entity for that matter."
"corpses.
they have all the necessary physical parts but you don’t see dead men walking around, do you?"
"yes, but nor do radios.
the parts need to not only exist, but they have to be functioning correctly for the body to perform its activities.
you take a radio and you throw it on the ground.
it stops working.
now, all the necessary parts are there, but they’re broken.
they aren’t functioning like they need to.
or would you say that the radio had a soul that resided inside it previously and allowed it to play music?
no, right?
the same way, our bodies die because our brain is not functioning like it needs to in order for us to be alive.
the brain is a peculiarly self supporting object.
it manufactures its own cerebrospinal fluid, and the processes of thought and memory which go on inside it are not impaired by the absence of limbs or torso, provided, as i say; that you keep pumping the right kind of oxygenated blood under the right conditions."
"but we are not like a radio.
we are more than mere machines."
"are we?"
"yes!
we do more than just what we're commanded to do!
we are built with reasoning capacity, with thoughts and reflections and desires and goals!
we don’t act in arbitrary fashion, we act purposefully.
we have beliefs and desires, things mere machines don’t."
that made namjoon pause and lean back in his seat.
"you’re right," he said, "a lightbulb has no desire to burn its tungsten, but that argument only goes as far as simple machines.
do you remember when jimin visited the third district last year?"
"what about it?"
"a few guys up there were building a machine that would be able to play chess," namjoon told me.
"chess," i echoed incredulously.
"yes, it may seem far-fetched to us, but imagine a machine like that.
say you move your bishop, and the machine moves its queen to trap the bishop.
would it not be natural to ascribe the desire of winning to the machine?
it’s got the ultimate desire to win the game and other supplementary goals of protecting its king, of capturing the opponent’s king.
it’s got beliefs about reaching its goals by blocking certain paths and moves.
it then amalgamates these desires, goals, and beliefs into action by making a move that is the rational response to its opponent’s move.
it seems natural to say then that the machine does have desires and beliefs, and that it does reason."
"but it doesn’t."
"how so?"
"sure, if a machine like this were to exist, it would be acting towards a goal.
it may seem like it’s got desires of its own, but it’s only behaving as such.
it’s only got, for the sake of this discussion let’s call it the "behavioral" aspect of the desire.
it doesn’t feel the emotions that led to the formation of the desire.
at the end of the day, it’s still following a chain of commands.
winning the game is not its own will.
it hasn’t got free will."
"and because we have free will, we must not be purely physical beings?"
"yes.
all physical beings are subject to determinism, and no object bound by deterministic laws can have free will.
therefore, there must be something more to us than the physical."
"it's a good argument."
namjoon smiled, but before i could respond, he held up three fingers in front of me.
"but for it to work, you need all three premises to be true."
namjoon brought down the first finger.
"first, that we have free will."
namjoon brought down his second finger.
"second being that nothing subject to determinism can have free will.
and for what it’s worth, i don’t myself believe that either of them are false."
then the third finger came down.
"but for the argument to be sound, you need its third premise to be true as well, and i'm not quite sure that that is the case.
'all physical systems are subject to determinism.' now this could be true, but a lot of recent empirical evidence gathered by scientists has started to suggest that the fundamental laws of physics governing this universe are in fact not deterministic, but probabilistic.
for example, say we have a radioactive atom that has an eighty percent chance it’ll break down in the next twenty four hours, and a twenty percent chance that it won’t.
you collect a bunch of these atoms, and eighty percent of them break down and twenty percent don’t.
now, according to the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, there’s no underlying causal explanation for why that happens, why the atoms that broke down did break down and why those that didn’t break down didn’t.
determinism claims that if you set up the atoms exactly the same way, they've always got to break down, right?
but the answer, according to the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, is that that’s not how it works.
all there is to say is that some of these atoms are going to break down and some won't.
so determinism isn’t true at least at the level of fundamental physics.
which gives way to the possibility that all purely physical systems are not deterministic, and that it is possible for us to have free will and be a purely physical being at the same time."
it was difficult to argue against that so i sighed and leaned back against my bed.
"fine," i conceded, "say you’re right and we’re entirely physical beings and keeping my brain alive is all there is to it.
but i honestly still think that it’s pointless.
what possible use is there in keeping my brain alive?
i won’t be able to talk or see or hear or feel a thing.
personally, i can’t think of a more unpleasant scenario."
"actually, i believe that we’ll be able to provide you with a certain amount of vision, but let us take this slowly.
i’ll explain the surgery to you in detail.
but before that, the fact still remains: you’re going to die fairly soon whatever happens, and if there’s anything i can do about it, i am."
"seems to me," i drawled, "there'd be some doubts as to whether i were dead or alive by the time you'd be finished with me."
namjoon laughed out loud and nodded his head in agreement before he stood up again and walked over to the window across the room.
"i suppose you’re right about that.
but i don't think you ought to turn me down quite so quickly before you know a bit more about it."
trying to stop namjoon was futile and i knew it so i didn’t bother.
as much as i disliked it, i must admit the idea intrigued me, at least on some superficial level.
"go on.
it is not as if i could come over there and stop you."
namjoon twisted around and quirked an eyebrow at me like he was coming to some kind of conclusion in his mind, but whatever it was, he didn’t say.
instead, he pulled out his case of cigarettes and plucked one out, placing it between his lips before he fetched a tiny silver lighter from the pocket of his trousers to light the stick.
"at the very moment of your death," he began after exhaling a mouthful of smoke, and i idly watched it rise up into the air till it dissipated.
"i would have to be standing close by so that i’d be able to step in immediately and try to keep your brain alive."
"you mean leaving it in the head?"
"to start with, yes.
i’d have to."
"and where will it be afterwards?"
"if you want to know, in a kind of basin."
"you’re serious?"
"certainly i am."
for a brief moment, i felt the absurdity of the discussion bubble up at the back of my throat, but i swallowed the sourness back down.
that i was even entertaining the thought was ridiculous in itself, but there was no point in bringing attention to it at that point.
"alright, go on."
"as you already know, when the heart stops working and the brain is deprived of its blood and oxygen, its tissues die very rapidly.
anything between four to six minutes and the whole thing's dead.
even after three minutes you may suffer some substantial amount of damage.
so i’d have to work very rapidly to prevent that from happening.
however, with the help of the machine, it shouldn’t be too difficult.
do you know anything about the vascular arrangement of the brain?"
"no."
"okay, listen to me carefully then.
the brain gets its blood supply from two main sources: the internal carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries.
there are two of each, making them four arteries in total.
got that?"
"yes."
"the return system is even simpler.
the blood is drained via two large veins, the internal jugulars.
so you have four arteries going up and two veins coming down.
around the brain itself they naturally branch out into other channels, but those don't concern us.
we’d never touch them."
namjoon pulled the cigarette from his mouth, holding it between two of his fingers and pointing it at me.
"now imagine you’ve just died."
"exciting."
"you’ve just died," namjoon continued, unconcerned.
"and i would immediately cut open your neck and locate the four arteries, the carotids and the vertebrals.
i would then perfuse them, which means i’ll basically stick a large hollow needle into each one of them.
these needles would be connected to the artificial heart via tubes.
then working quickly, i would dissect both the left and right jugular veins and hook them up to the machine as well to complete the circuit, and there you are, the circulation to your brain would be restored."
"i’d be like that dog."
"i don’t think you would.
you’d certainly lose consciousness when you die, and i don’t think you’d regain it for quite some time.
but either way, conscious or not, you’d be in a rather interesting position, don’t you think?
a living brain inside a dead body."
it sounded like a frightful nightmare.
but the excitement was evident in namjoon’s voice, and i don’t think he noticed that i didn’t share it.
it was as if he was unable to imagine why anybody would not feel the same entrancement that he did.
"we could now afford to take our time," he said.
"and believe me, we’d need it.
we’d first wheel you to the operating room, accompanied by your heart of course.
it must never stop pumping.
and the next problem would then be to remove your brain from your dead body, undamaged and intact.
the body is of no use at this point.
in fact, it’s already begun to decay."
i stared at the ceiling just to look away from namjoon for some time.
the unease had begun to crawl in finally.
the conversation had finally departed from the realm of the detached, and it didn’t feel so much like a hypothetical anymore.
it made my stomach tighten with a foreboding sense of horror, and i watched the white plaster and the fan slowly making its circles as namjoon continued to describe with a discomforting clinicality what he was going to do to me.
"the skull and the face would be useless too.
they’d both be hindrances, and i don’t want them around.
all i want is the brain.
so when i get you on the table, i will take a small oscillating saw and proceed to remove the whole vault of your skull.
you'd still be unconscious at that point so i wouldn't need to bother with the anaesthetic."
that had my head snapping back down to meet namjoon’s gaze.
"like hell you wouldn’t."
"you just died a few minutes ago.
you’d be out cold, i promise you."
"nobody’s sawing off the top of my skull without an anaesthetic," i said.
for one brief moment, namjoon parted his lips as if to argue, but then he closed it again and shrugged his shoulders, probably realising that it wasn’t worth the fight.
"doesn’t make a difference to me.
i’d be glad to infuse your whole head from neck up with procaine if that’s what you want."
"thank you."
"it’s funny though," namjoon began, "just last week a patient was brought to me unconscious, and i opened his head without any anaesthetic at all.
i was still working inside the skull, trying to remove a small blood clot, when he woke up and began talking to me as if nothing was wrong.
he couldn’t feel a thing, and the next day he held no recollection of the incident when i asked him about it.
the brain is truly a funny thing."
"i’ll have the procaine," i told him pointedly.
"as you wish, taehyung-ah."
namjoon rolled his eyes.
"now, where was i?
yes, i'd take the oscillating saw and detach your calvarium completely.
this would expose the top half of the brain, or rather the outer covering within which the brain is wrapped."
namjoon slowly strided back to the bedside where he’d dragged his chair to sit beside me.
he seated himself in it again and leaned over me to knock his knuckle against my temple.
i flinched back, and namjoon grinned.
"you may not know this but our brains have three separate coverings: the dura mater, the arachnoid, and the pia mater.
most people believe that the brain just floats around naked inside the skull, but it’s actually wrapped up nicely inside these three membranes, and the cerebrospinal fluid flows between the pia mater and the arachnoid.
now, i myself would leave these three coverings intact for several important reasons, one of them being that within the dura run the venous channels that drain the blood from the brain into the jugular veins."
namjoon took a pause and leaned back in his chair.
his face wasn’t as unconcerned as before.
his eyebrows knitted together in the center and his lips pressed together in a fine line.
"the next few steps are trickier.
we’d have to lift the whole brain cleanly, and this would mean chipping away a whole lot of bone, severing many nerves, and cutting and tying numerous blood vessels.
the only way i could perform it with any hope of success would be by taking a rongeur and slowly biting off the rest of your skull until the underneath of the brain covering is fully exposed.
the problems involved are highly technical so i won't go into them, but i feel fairly confident that it can be done.
it's simply a matter of surgical skill and patience.
and i'd have plenty of time since the artificial heart would be pumping away alongside the operating-table and keeping the brain alive.
now, say that i’m able to successfully do that, your brain only remains connected to the body by the spinal column.
i would need to sever the spinal column just above the first cervical vertebra.
the dura mater is open at this place to receive the spinal cord so i’d have to sew it shut.
there’d be no problem there, and after that we’d finally be able to move the brain to a basin which would be filled with what we call the ringer’s solution.
it’s a fluid used for irrigation in neurosurgery."
namjoon stared at me with a wide grin, his arms spread wide open and his fingers splayed out, like he was a gameshow host presenting me with the first prize.
"so there you go, your brain would then be in the basin, still alive, and there doesn’t seem to be any reason why it shouldn’t remain like that for years to come if we took care of the blood and the machine."
"but would it function?"
i asked him skeptically, and namjoon’s smile fell.
"i’m afraid there’s no way i can tell for certain.
i don’t even know whether you’d regain consciousness or not."
"and if i did?"
"then wouldn’t it be wonderful?"
"would it?"
"of course!
you’d have all your cognitive faculties about you as well as your memory and—" "and not be able to see, hear, talk, feel or move.
yes, very wonderful indeed."
"ah!"
namjoon exclaimed suddenly.
"i knew i had forgotten something.
i never told you about the eye.
i am going to try to leave one of your optic nerves intact, as well as the eye itself.
the optic nerve is not a nerve really, it’s the outpouching of the brain itself and the dura mater extends along the length of it and is attached to the eyeball.
it all suits my purpose very well and makes it reasonable to suppose that i could succeed in preserving one of your eyes."
"wonderful.
how about leaving me an ear as well?"
"no, no that would not be possible."
"why not?
i want an ear," i said.
"i insist upon an ear."
"you don’t understand how difficult it would be."
namjoon said gently.
"the mechanism of the ear is much more delicate than that of the eye.
its hearing apparatus, the cochlea, is encased in bone.
as is the auditory nerve that is connected to the brain.
i couldn’t possibly chisel out the whole thing intact."
"couldn’t you leave it encased in the bone and bring it to the basin?"
"no," namjoon said firmly.
"this thing is complicated enough already.
you really must leave it to me to decide what is feasible and what is not."
"i haven’t actually said that i’d do it, you know."
"yes i know, taehyung."
"and i’m not quite sure that i fancy the idea."
"would you rather be dead instead?"
"perhaps i would."
at that namjoon’s eyes narrowed.
he stood up from his chair and sat on the bed beside me.
"do you truly believe that?"
he asked me.
i met his gaze and there was that hardness in them, the one that spoke of everything he’d seen in his career and his life.
"tell me," i said to him, feeling the question on my tongue.
it had been there for a while.
"why do you care so much about keeping me alive?"
the way namjoon’s jaw tightened told me that the question was not unanticipated.
"of course i care.
you’re our leader—" "but is my life any more important than any other fighter?"
i cut him off.
namjoon fell silent.
for a few moments, neither of us spoke.
the silence was heavy with the weight of unspoken memories.
"don’t you see them?"
i asked namjoon.
"our comrades?"
there was not a day that went by when i didn’t feel them breathing down my neck like cold damp ghosts pressed against my back.
"i led them to their deaths, screaming a whole slew of lies about sacrifice and freedom.
told them to give up their lives for the greater good."
i laughed.
to think they’d listened to a fool like me.
"i see them at night, you know?
they keep asking me what became of the hearts they gave up."
the first tear escaped, and i leaned against the headboard and laughed again.
there’s no doubt that i looked like a maniac, staring at the ceiling like a fucking fool and laughing as i cried.
namjoon didn’t speak a word.
"have i any right to live?
look at me!"
snapping my head back down to meet namjoon’s eyes, i pulled the blanket off my lower half and exposed what savage stubs remained of my legs.
"is this what you want to save?
i killed men!
lied to them right till the end and led them straight to hell!
i am a monster!"
i grabbed namjoon by the front of his shirt and yanked him closer till our noses were nearly an inch apart.
"so don’t fucking tell me i deserve to live any more than they did," i hissed at him.
the surprise had vanished from namjoon’s face.
in its place was a hardness that cemented itself in the lines of his face.
namjoon slowly grabbed my hand by the wrist.
"you’re wrong," he spoke slowly, but certainly.
"no death has been in vain.
don’t you ever fucking say that their sacrifice amounted to nothing.
we’re where we are because of the deaths of those before us, and we’re the ones who give meaning to their lives.
it is the only way we can rebel in this cruel world.
which is why i need you to live.
not because you deserve to live any longer or because i value your life over everybody else’s.
no, but because you’re our leader, and you are to play that monster, that bastard, right until the end, deceiving us to the very end.
you need to live so that we can use you.
that’s all there is to this."
i let go of namjoon’s shirt wordlessly and fell back against the bed, staring at the ceiling once again.
"i’m sorry," namjoon said softly.
"don’t be."
there was a pause as i watched the circling fan blades idly.
i do not know how long the silence stretched but when namjoon spoke again, the quality to his voice was a little different.
more uncertain.
"i have yet to tell you one more thing," he said.
"about my body, i presume?"
"yes."
i had guessed it was something like that.
"initially, jimin and i had come up with a roadmap of sorts.
but we underestimated how fast the illness would spread.
there’s a man up in the third district who’s doing some work in thought communication.
jimin has been in touch with him.
you know how our brain throws off electrical and chemical discharges while thinking?
and that these discharges go out in the form of waves, rather like radio waves?"
"i have some idea."
"well the guy has constructed an apparatus somewhat similar to an ordinary electro-encephalograph, but far more sensitive.
he maintains that, with a few limitations, it can interpret what a brain is thinking.
it produces some kind of a graph which is apparently decipherable into words or thoughts.
i have yet to see it do that, but we thought we could somehow integrate that with sound technology and give you your own voice.
jimin claims he can build you a body and perhaps sensory stimulation in the future.
but your condition has been deteriorating at a rate neither of us anticipated.
so at this point, while we have high hopes for the surgery, the matter of building your body is yet undecided."
"i see."
"i will not lie to you, taehyung.
the operation is rudimentary at best.
there are a lot of pieces to it we are yet to figure out, but we are running out of time.
i know it does not sound reassuring, and you don’t have to answer me immediately."
namjoon pushed himself back on his feet.
"i will let you think it over in your time.
i’ll drop by day after tomorrow and we can discuss this in further detail if you wish."
namjoon had crossed the room and his hand was on the doorknob when i stopped him.
"one last question.
do you yourself truly believe that when all of this is over, when my brain inside that basin, is that still going to be me?"
"i don’t see why not," namjoon said, eyebrows crinkling in question.
"you’re still the same person after losing your legs.
clearly, we are still us even if we lose portions of our body.
which then begs the question: which part of our body is the most essential in the matter of our personal identity?
it would be obvious to suggest the brain, right?
after all, our brain is what is responsible for our cognition, our personality, our beliefs, desires, fears, and memories.
and your brain will remain undamaged.
in fact, it’s completely untouched.
we haven’t even opened the dura mater.
the big difference is that we’ve severed all but one nerve attached to it.
which just means that your thinking will no longer be affected by your senses.
you couldn't possibly feel pain because there wouldn't be any nerves to feel it with.
in a way, it would be an almost ideal condition."
i had a few things to say about how far from ideal it would be, but i was tired.
namjoon left soon after that with promises to drop by the day after the next, and i spent the entire day and night peeling and picking apart the absurd proposition placed before me.
the idea was unarguably repulsive.
it was obscene.
the tremendous helplessness that accompanied it frightened me.
once namjoon put my brain inside that basin, there would be no going back, no way of protesting or revolting.
but at the same time, the more i pondered, the more i began to consider it.
despite its obvious obscenity, i began to see the thought in a different light.
was there not, i asked myself, something comforting in the fact that i could escape death in some form?
that i wouldn’t completely vanish and cease to exist in just a few weeks’ worth of time?
my body was dying.
there was nothing of it worth preserving anymore.
and here, i was being presented with a rare opportunity of getting another chance at life beyond this broken body.
but most of all, there was one salient thought that i now realise was the true tipping point.
i felt a desire to cheat the system.
the very system we’ve been fighting for years.
i felt i could somehow win the awful odds we’d been given.
cheat the corrupt officials and cheat the ministry.
cheat the military and cheat every bloody person who set up this very system designed for us to fail.
for us to die miserably without food or money or sunlight, grovelling at the feet of the higher-ups.
i wanted to defy the death they’d decided for me.
that was the thought that cemented my decision, and i remember feeling much at ease once i’d made it.
i gave namjoon my answer when he dropped by the next time, and i remember how my appetite increased as well in the coming days and you were so shocked and elated.
this happened two months ago.
and i’ve been writing this letter to you for a couple of weeks now.
my strength has waned in this time.
jungkook offered to write for me instead, but i wanted to do it myself.
namjoon, jimin, and i have discussed several things since that day.
they asked me if i was going to tell you, and i told them that i was.
you deserve to know the truth, and i tried to give you as accurate an account of the events that occurred as i could.
i imagine you feel overwhelmed right now, and most likely betrayed for i kept something as big as this from you.
but my intention was never to hurt you; quite the opposite actually.
we’ve fought so much about this, but darling, please, you must know that i only ever want to protect you.
you always tried to help in my matters, but i could never allow you to do that.
you know that.
you got angry when i kept things from you, but i do not wish for you to get caught up in all this.
this entire fucking nation could be burning all the way to hell, and i’d still only protect you.
and this was my way of doing that.
i am telling it to you because you’re my husband and you deserve to know, but i do not wish to involve you in this.
it is my wish that you do not come to look for me.
i know you’ll want to.
you’re still hurt, but you must let it heal.
please.
you must strive to be happy.
and i cannot give you that happiness any longer.
i became unable to do so a long time ago.
so promise me, you must promise that you won’t come looking for me.
please forgive me for asking this of you.
i love you.
you know that, right?
within minutes of meeting you, i knew that my life would never, could never be the same again.
i won’t hide it; i am so unused to being understood, so unused to being seen, but you saw me.
you understood me like no other.
i thought to myself that it must be fate.
it felt like the glass in my eyes was waiting for your reflection, the expanse of my skin waiting for your touch like spring, my mouth parched for yours in a way i did not know myself until i tasted you.
i swear i have never loved before as i love you, to the point of tears and with such brilliance.
you used to tell me that we’re all made of dead stars, and i do not know much about that, but if there’s one thing i know with utmost certainty, it is that darling, you are undeniably other-worldly.
i dreamt of you last night, truly my last one.
you were playing the piano and i was turning the pages for you.
i cried when i woke up.
i am the luckiest bastard to have lived, to have married you, love.
thank you for giving me the chance to have known you, min yoongi.
you are a marvel.
yours, taehyung we’re all made of dead stars, yoongi’s mother always liked to tell him, and it was his favourite story to hear, to know about how they all came to be, how they all began from one tiny fraction that exploded to create everything that they know in the universe.
the first law of thermodynamics, one that yoongi quickly learnt would grow to govern everything in his life, states that matter and energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it simply changes form.
so everything, including their bodies, is created of matter that has been around since 13.8 billion years ago.
and at the beginning, there were only two elements that existed: hydrogen and helium.
but then gravity began to clump together clouds of hydrogen and helium, and stars were born.
the "sun" is one such star.
yoongi’s mother speaks of it fondly.
but unlike his mother, who lived on the earth's surface for a brief time when she was a child, yoongi never saw the sun.
he was born in district 1, the closest their kind can get to the surface, other than the capitol of course.
the capitol is where the rich ministers and aristocrats live, and yoongi’s only heard tales of their opulence, of their gardens, their lush lands and sunlight.
everybody else lives in districts, cities that are built under the ground and stacked atop each other in a vertical arrangement, where district 1 is the richest and the closest to the surface, and the poorest city, district 8, lies at the very bottom.
each district is known for what it primarily exports: district 1 for its gems and alchemy, district 2 for its defense and weaponry, district 3 for its technology, and district 4 for its electricity.
but for all their differences, all districts share the same gruelling fate of no sunlight, little food, and a whole lot of disease.
yoongi was born in an affluent family of alchemists in the first district, and like all who came before him, he was recruited into the military when he turned seventeen.
alchemy is a rare and treasured knowledge, known and passed only within the few chosen families, and theirs is a powerful ancestry of alchemists.
he’s a natural, everybody would gasp and clap their hands, smiles high on their cheeks as they praised yoongi and proclaimed him a prodigy.
but alchemy is hardly an innate talent.
and yoongi knows that better than anybody else.
it is years and years of study and experiments and research culminated by each generation and passed down onto the next heir with a mountain of responsibility to hold up the integrity of the family and keep the state from dissolving them.
dogs of the ministry are what they are called by the rest of the nation, much like how jimin had sneered at yoongi upon their first meeting, teeth bared and derision dripping from his lips, but yoongi doesn’t blame him.
there are people like jimin, like namjoon and like taehyung, who cannot stand the state’s authoritarian oppression and choose to rebel against it, no matter how difficult and impossible it may be.
and then there are people like yoongi, who have been taught to keep their heads down for that is the only way to live a sorrowless life in their world.
rebellion may enchant the idealists, but it only brings misery.
yoongi’s pragmatic mother had drilled that into his head ever since yoongi was four and learnt that his family is powerful only as long as it serves the state.
keep your head down if you don’t want a bullet for a third eye, she used to shake him by the shoulders and hiss at him, and yoongi listened to her.
he studied and trained in the military and fought their wars, wars that the state promised would bring their nation more land and more people would be able to live on the surface.
but after four years of hellfire, the lands naturally went to the piggish ministers sitting in the capitol, so dogs of the ministry, yoongi thinks, is about right.
"140g of sulfur," yoongi mutters lowly as he fetches a few crumpled notes from the pocket of his coat.
it would be much simpler to flash his identification card since all state alchemists’ ingredient expenses are covered by the state.
but cash is the only way to make untraceable purchases in markets like these where no pair of eyes is to be trusted.
the man retreats into his shop to fetch the ingredient, and yoongi feels jimin stiffen beside him with all the alertness of an agitated watchdog.
"how do you know that he isn’t going to alert the authorities right now?"
he mutters under his breath, voice so low it nearly goes unheard in the noise of the rowdy market.
"he has no rational reason to."
yoongi rolls his eyes even though jimin can’t see it under the hood yoongi has pulled over his head.
"several alchemists make dubious purchases they don’t want traced.
if he began to report every underhanded transaction he’s made, he’s going to run out of business."
jimin clicks his tongue, clearly unconvinced, but he relaxes when the man returns with their ingredient.
"100g of saltpeter," yoongi speaks the next item off his list and watches the man’s face carefully for even the most subtle sign of recognition, but the man looks wholly uninterested in everything but the money.
he holds out a palm until yoongi places another note in it before he retreats into the shop again.
water, 35l carbon, 20kg ammonia, 4l lime, 1.5kg phosphorus, 800g salt, 250g sulfur, 140g saltpeter, 100g sodium, 100g chlorine, 95g magnesium, 19g iron, 5g silicon, 3g the ingredients that make up a human body are laughably simple to acquire.
they’re all common purchases that are used in numerous other transmutations, none of them unusual enough to evoke suspicion.
but used together, and yoongi would be committing a taboo of the highest degree.
there were three dictates that he’d had to swear to abide by when he was made a state alchemist.
do not oppose the state, do not create gold, and do not create humans.
but despite what the dictates say, human transmutation has been deemed impossible to execute for centuries.
many alchemists have attempted it in the past, have collected their measurements of what makes up a human body and transmuted those elements to weave together the complex arrangements of nerves, muscles, and bones.
but every experiment resulted in failure.
the bodies born out of those experiments were all inanimate corpses with no "mind" to speak of.
some call it the "soul".
and there is no physical ingredient of a soul, they say, which makes human transmutation a matter of alchemical fiction.
yoongi himself doesn't particularly believe in souls, but he agrees that there is more to the transmutation than simply collecting the physical ingredients that constitute a human body.
human consciousness is a mystery for all known sciences, and nobody has yet come any closer to unveiling it.
one simply cannot recreate a human mind with the technology at hand.
but as yoongi and jimin make their way through the crowd towards the giant steam-powered lifts in the center of the city, he considers namjoon's reckless operation.
up until now, nobody has attempted to preserve the brain that's responsible for the elusive consciousness, and then attempted to build a body around it.
yoongi has no precedent to refer to, has nothing to measure their probability of success against.
the operation is worse than reckless.
it isn’t just thoughtless.
it is cruel.
but yoongi has no other choice.
he is not going to wait for namjoon and jimin to figure out how they’d build taehyung's body out of some metal and junk.
he's not going to sit around doing nothing when he has no idea what state taehyung is in, if he's in pain or if he's even conscious.
the experiment may be risky, but there is no better alternative.
the only other option is that, instead of building him a new body, yoongi writes the transmutation in a manner that he simply transmutes taehyung's corpse back from decay.
it would surely be the simpler task given how taehyung's body already contains all of its parts, but bringing taehyung's corpse back to life would mean bringing his illness back to life too.
yoongi had attempted to cure taehyung's illness countless times in the past.
but each time he healed taehyung's legs, the disease returned with a vengeance.
and after months and months of failure, yoongi and namjoon had to conclude that the illness was rooted in the genetic makeup of taehyung's cells, something yoongi couldn't rewrite, didn't have enough knowledge to study and heal.
which leaves yoongi with the singular option of building taehyung a body from scratch.
when the lift comes to a stop with a jarring jolt, yoongi steadies himself and stiffens his spine as the steam clears and he steps out of the doors and into the stale air of district 4.
most districts look the same, dark and desolate streets patrolled by state officials in black uniforms and blinking taser guns, but yoongi probably likes the fourth district the best.
not that there is anything to like in its daily grind and grit, but it’s perhaps the only one whose spirit hasn’t entirely been crushed by the state.
it’s also the one where yoongi met taehyung for the first time after freshly graduating from the military academy.
district 4 isn’t a state bootlicker like district 2, nor is it a city of elusive elites like district 1.
automated machinery doesn’t populate it like it does in district 3, and it isn’t a dismal wasteland like district 8.
no, in district 4, new state officials grow a habit of looking over their shoulders as the night descends, and civilians are able to go about their lives without having to fear boots against their bones.
district 4 holds the reputation of hoarding the largest resistance group in the nation.
the air here remains steady and just a little bit hopeful, reminding yoongi of life, of growing things, of fight and change and survival, and he can ignore the war—and his role in it—even if it’s just for a little while.
yoongi takes in the darkening cityscape and feels his lips curl up unbidden at the memory of taehyung and him climbing the staircase spiralling around the large water tank; the bite of the cool wind against their skins and taehyung’s dry lips against his own when he proposed, words whispered into yoongi’s mouth and a cold silver band pressed into his palm like a promise of hope.
but that hope comes with a cost, because the state’s security is tighter in district 4 than anywhere else.
jimin and yoongi duck under the cover of the shadows in dark alleys and press their backs against walls as they dodge the guards and catch their breaths urgently.
the curfew wouldn’t be a problem if yoongi was alone, but jimin’s presence would be hard to explain to the guards patrolling the area when nobody called park jimin exists in the city’s database.
so the journey from the lifts to the deserted outskirts of the district ends up taking them four hours to cover, and it’s close to the deepest trenches of the night when they burst through the doors of the abandoned research center that serves as the resistance’s primary laboratory.
jungkook meets them at the doors, but yoongi pushes past him.
because standing at the end of the long, dimly lit hallway is namjoon.
his back is turned towards yoongi, but yoongi would recognise him anywhere, and he has imagined this circumstance far too long and far too often to wait any longer.
he drops the bags of his purchases and stalks towards the man.
jimin must’ve caught on because he calls out yoongi’s name from behind, and namjoon twists around at the sound.
his eyes widen at the sight of yoongi, but it’s too late, and before he can think to move or think to orient himself differently, yoongi’s fist is meeting the front of namjoon’s nose with a loud satisfying crack.
there’s a scramble of feet and shouts behind him, but yoongi grabs namjoon by his lab coat and gets to plummet another punch into his bloodied face before arms wrap themselves around yoongi’s torso and yank him away from namjoon.
namjoon falls to his knees, palms cradling his bloody nose, and yoongi snarls at him despite the arms pulling at him to further the distance between the two of them.
"calm down!
you need to calm down," jimin hisses into his ear, clearly the owner of the strong arms around yoongi’s ribs.
"this won’t help anything.
we need to work together."
yoongi rams an elbow into jimin’s stomach, and jimin wheezes, gasping and coughing as yoongi pushes himself out of his hold.
"work together?"
he sneers, swerving around to stare first at jimin, and then at namjoon who is pressing one palm against his bleeding nose and holding the other in the air towards jungkook, who looks one moment away from pouncing atop yoongi as well.
yoongi lets out a sardonic laugh, and it rings hollow in the empty building.
"that’s rich coming from the lot of you."
"it was taehyung’s wish to not involve you in this operation."
namjoon slowly pushes himself off the floor, and yoongi has to grit his teeth and trample down the urge to kick the man back down there.
"but you didn’t agree, did you?"
he hisses.
"so you lied to him.
told him that you had no clue about building his body back.
and then you approached me, knowing that there’s no way i could refuse."
"you can refuse.
if you choose not to involve yourself in this operation, we’ll still go forward.
we have no intention of forcing—" "forcing me?"
yoongi wants to laugh.
the piece of paper informing yoongi about their location in namjoon's writing that he'd found slipped into the envelope along with taehyung's letter lies crumpled in the pocket of his coat still.
"you didn’t inform me because you knew i would never agree to your retarded experiment.
you didn’t inform me, but you had all intentions of involving me."
he takes a step forward and grabs namjoon by the collar once again, bringing their faces close enough to make the unspoken threat clear.
"where is he?"
namjoon's eyes hold his gaze for a moment, and then slowly slide to the side where yoongi knows jungkook is gearing up to tear yoongi off namjoon, but yoongi doesn't bother looking away from namjoon.
nobody in this room poses any real threat to him.
"it’s fine, jungkook," namjoon says finally, and he looks back at yoongi again.
"he isn’t wrong.
we did manipulate them.
but yoongi, you’re wrong to assume that taehyung has been entirely truthful in his letter to you."
yoongi bares his teeth and hates how easily he takes the bait, fingers curling so tight around namjoon's collar, his knuckles dig into the thin skin of the man's throat.
namjoon wheezes a little but goes on.
"he didn't lie to you, but he did omit a few details.
the first day i visited him, i’d implored him to tell you.
jimin and i have always desired your cooperation.
it would be the ideal scenario.
but taehyung was adamant about your uninvolvement in this operation.
he wanted to keep you away from it.
his reasons, despite not being the most rational, were understandable.
he cares for you deeply."
namjoon struggles to pull in a breath, and yoongi loosens his hold until the man gasps and continues, "jimin and i were forced to go against his wishes for his own sake.
we had to contact you despite his instructions to us.
but make no mistake, even if you didn't agree, we'd still figure out a way to bring him back.
it would just cost us time we cannot really afford.
your help is valuable to us, but it's not irreplaceable.
i will not force you to do this."
yoongi lets him go, and namjoon stumbles back, palms on his chest as he bends over and tries to regain his breathing.
jungkook and jimin rush to help him, and yoongi presses his eyes shut just as a wave of helplessness tries to drown him.
he pulls in a trembling inhale and snaps his eyes wide open once again.
there will be time for emotion later.
"where is he?"
he manages to ask again, and his voice holds; doesn’t break like how he feels he might.
namjoon looks up at him, but this time, he straightens and wordlessly gestures at yoongi to follow him.
their footsteps follow a somber rhythm as namjoon leads yoongi down a long quiet corridor.
jimin and jungkook had made a motion to follow, but they remained where they stood after a look from namjoon that yoongi hadn’t bothered to decipher.
it’s been four weeks since yoongi received taehyung’s letter, since the nature of his husband’s "death" was revealed to him, but it is the first time yoongi finds himself truly unable to confront the truth of the matter.
he’d been analytical about it at first, had read the letter about ten more times after his first read.
save for the final few paragraphs that taehyung had dedicated to him, because yoongi could not go through those more than once, he’d picked and peeled apart every other word that taehyung had penned in his letter to him, and then sat on the floor and stared into the fireplace for over an hour.
he didn’t cry.
he’d wanted to, but he couldn’t.
taehyung was still out there, in some shape or form that was not known to yoongi, but he was still there.
he wasn’t dead.
yoongi wasn’t sure if he could say that his husband was alive either, but he was not a corpse, and any time yoongi was not investing into searching for a way to bring him back was a waste of his time.
he hadn’t cried for four full weeks, but he feels his throat tightening now, as namjoon’s footsteps steadily slow down and the frightful dread grows roots into the pit of yoongi’s stomach.
"be careful.
it may shock you, but remember that he can still see you."
yoongi can’t bring himself to respond when namjoon comes to a stop before an unassuming white door.
"take your time when you enter," namjoon speaks again as his hand twists the knob.
"he won't know you're there until you place your face directly above his eye.
the eye is always open.
he can't move it at all, so his field of vision is very narrow.
at the moment, we have it looking up at the ceiling.
he obviously cannot hear anything so you have to hold up signs or enunciate your words very slowly and clearly in front of the eye if you wish to speak to him.
we have no way of knowing if he can sense or understand us.
we do not yet know if he’s conscious at all."
despite having twisted the knob, namjoon doesn’t open the door.
he remains where he stands, staring at yoongi like he can see right through him.
and yoongi grits his teeth and tramples down the terror that threatens to throttle his throat.
he pushes past namjoon and swings the door open, revealing the small square room behind it.
but before he can take another step into it, namjoon grabs him by the forearm and keeps him where he is.
"stay back here until you get used to it," he says, and yoongi turns around to look at him, at his hard gaze and the harsh lines on his face, and snatches his arm out of namjoon’s grip.
"i’m fine," he hisses before turning around to stare at the white enamel bowl about the size of a washbasin placed on a table in the centre of the room.
half a dozen thin plastic tubes emerge out of it, carrying the blood to and from the heart machine that is kept on the floor, a large complicated thing itself that makes a loud rhythmic pulsing sound that echoes in the small room.
"come a little closer."
namjoon grabs his hand this time, leading him two paces forward.
the basin is too high for yoongi to look into completely, but at this distance, he can see the surface of the liquid inside it.
it is clear and still, and a small oval capsule floats on it.
"that's the eye in there," namjoon says.
"it is his right eye, and it’s still in perfect condition.
as far as we can tell, he can see just well as he could before."
yoongi feels bile rise up to his throat, but he swallows it down and lets namjoon lead him even closer to the table till they’re standing just a couple of feet away from it and yoongi feels his knees freeze stiff in their refusal to move any further.
"there you are," namjoon says.
"that's taehyung."
yoongi’s body jerks forward instinctively as if to retch, but namjoon grips him by the back of his jacket, fisting the fabric tight and keeping him upright.
yoongi’s mouth trembles open as he heaves for air, knees shaking and threatening to deposit him on the floor, but even then, he can’t tear his eyes away from the bottom of the basin where taehyung lies: dark in color and with ridges and grooves running over his surface, stubs of the four big arteries and the two veins coming out from the base of him and joining the plastic tubes that go directly into the heart machine.
"you must control your emotions," namjoon tells him, not unkindly, but yoongi flinches anyway.
namjoon lets go of him, and yoongi bends down low as he takes in another steadying breath even if it feels like he’s going to keel over and throw up at any moment.
when he straightens, he takes a careful step forward, towards the horrendous setup.
namjoon doesn’t follow him this time.
yoongi hears the doctor retreat from the room and close the door behind him, and he steps up to the edge of the table, leaning forward until his face is directly over the basin and he is looking straight down into taehyung’s eye.
and for some unfathomable reason, this is when he falls apart for the first time after four weeks.
"taehyung-ah," he whispers wetly and has to bite down on his lip to keep down the sob growing at the back of his throat.
instead, he pulls his lips into a wet forced smile, an effort that is certainly in vain because taehyung would be able to see right through him.
the pupil remains large and black, staring back at yoongi unblinkingly, a manner that is so unlike taehyung because yoongi has not known a man more expressive than his husband.
he laughs wetly, feeling as if he’s truly been driven deranged, and he grips the edge of the table tightly as he stares down at it.
he’s used to being alone; war does that to you.
he’s seen friends be killed, has killed a few of them himself.
loneliness is not foreign to him.
and yet— "i miss you," he’s saying before he can think to stop himself.
it doesn’t matter, he thinks humorlessly, taehyung cannot hear him.
he might not even be conscious.
or alive.
and then the dam truly breaks.
"i miss you so fucking much, tae, and i—" he no longer bothers to stop the tears gathering in his eyes.
when he tries to stare at his husband’s eye, still floating lifelessly in the basin, it’s all blurry, and he hates it.
"you were always like this.
you’re always running ahead of me, and i feel as if i’ve spent my entire life just trying to catch up to you."
he eventually chokes on his tears.
"i miss you so much, love," he confesses shakily, his voice finally giving up on him, and his shoulders shake and tremble and then curl inwards.
"i'm doing everything for you tae," he exhales, trying to wipe the tears away with his palms.
it’s not working.
"i’m going to fix it all, okay?
i don’t care what it takes.
i’ll do it all.
i—i love you.
you know that too, don’t you?"
he forces a laugh even if his entire chest feels like it’s caving in.
he has no other choice.
there's nobody else he can trust to do this but himself.
we’re all made of dead stars, his mother used to say, and when he hears the door open behind him, yoongi takes a step back and turns around to see jimin standing there at the threshold.
if jimin notices the tear tracks—there is no way that he doesn’t—he doesn’t comment on it.
instead, he brings their purchases to yoongi, and yoongi takes them from him with shaky hands.
taehyung was the only person who knew what yoongi’s source was.
it is a secret that all alchemists carry to their grave, but yoongi had whispered his into the slope of taehyung’s neck as they lay tangled on the bed, deep into the night of their wedding.
yoongi now bites into the thin skin of his thumb and lets the blood fill his mouth, before it dribbles down his chin and then drips on the floor.
from the corner of his eye, he sees namjoon and jungkook arrive as well, but they don’t enter the room.
jimin is the only one who helps yoongi as he kneels down and drags his thumb in a large circle across the floor.
all alchemy follows the law of equivalent exchange.
the circle of ouroborus, the circle of death and rebirth, of decomposition and reconstruction, it’s all the same.
because matter can neither be created nor destroyed; it simply changes form.
everything, including their bodies, is created of matter that has been around since 13.8 billion years ago.
we’re all made of dead stars, his mother used to say, because all stars eventually run out of hydrogen and helium as fuel.
and when the fusion of heavier elements occurs, requiring higher and higher temperatures and leading to the formation of heavier and heavier elements, the star ultimately collapses.
it explodes and flings its matter into the rest of the universe, the ashes of it nourishing the solar systems and the planets to further evolve into complex organisms like humans.
from stardust to humans and back to ash, everything is created of the same matter.
it simply evolves, decomposes, and is brought back to life in another form.
this cycle is the basis for all alchemy, and even though several alchemists claim that humans are exceptional, different from the rest of organic matter, yoongi doesn’t quite hold that degree of self-conceit.
according to him, human transmutation should be no different from all the other alchemical processes, and he spent the past four weeks writing and perfecting this transmutation based on that very assumption.
he bites another finger when his thumb dries, and then another and then one more, until his entire hand is soaked in his blood and he has the entire circle covered in glyphs and slanted writing that details the transmutation process.
jimin brings the ingredients to him, and yoongi measures each one of them with precision: water, 35l, carbon, 20kg, ammonia, 4l, lime, 1.5kg, phosphorus, 800g, salt, 250g, sulfur, 140g, saltpeter, 100g, sodium, 100g, chlorine, 95g, magnesium, 19g, iron, 5g, silicon, 3g.
"namjoon," he calls out when he’s done, and doesn’t say any further.
namjoon understands him though, and yoongi has to resist the urge to squeeze his eyes shut when he hears the enamel bowl being placed in the center of the circle.
he doesn’t look up at it, just watches as some of the liquid spills on the ground and grows pink when it streams over the blood glyphs.
namjoon, jungkook, and jimin retreat to the entryway once again, and yoongi kneels over the circle.
typically, he wouldn’t need such an intricate setup.
alchemy requires a circle, and yoongi would simply clap his hands and form a center within his body, but this is beyond anything he’s ever performed, and without his source, channelling the earth’s energy from the movement of its tectonic plates is his best wager.
because yoongi’s source is, extremely ironically, the sun, singularly the one thing he’ll never see in his life.
when he’d told taehyung this, his husband had pressed a kiss to his knuckles and promised him that he’d take him to the surface to see it.
yoongi doesn’t realise when the tears escape him, but he feels the wet slide of them down his face when he claps his hands and slaps his bloody palms on the floor.
he has to squeeze his eyes shut once the transmutation begins and he feels the familiar tug in the pit of his belly, like there are hands twisting his insides and tugging them out of him.
the earth beneath him slowly starts to shake, and yoongi feels the exertion in his bones, but he pushes on, pressing his eyes tighter as the hands in his stomach twist and twist and twist, wringing him dry.
there is a crash as the shaking grows more powerful, and the enamel bowl tips over and falls against the ground, but yoongi forces himself to remain where he is.
it’s painful and slow going.
he doesn’t know how long he stays bent over the floor, muscles straining and teeth clenched tight as the transmutation pulls everything out of him.
yoongi’s legs give out from under him at one point, and somewhere far ahead of him, he hears jimin gasp, but he doesn’t open his eyes, pressing them tighter till his head hurts, and then some more.
something unmistakably large and alive is thrashing on the ground, and yoongi is gritting his teeth so hard, he thinks he’ll crush them.
he screams when his vision goes blindingly white from the agony.
it’s as if all of him is being scorched from inside, and he screams and screams deafeningly, till his throat feels like it’ll scrape and bleed.
and then, as abruptly as it came, the pain leaves him.
in its place, the exhaustion seeps in and settles thickly into lungs, and yoongi gasps for air and then collapses on the wet floor.
he hears shouts and loud talking.
namjoon is barking orders, and there are arms pulling yoongi upright.
he feels himself being lifted, and when he pulls his eyes open, an effort that causes him to nearly collapse once again, the room is dark, and— in the middle of the circle lies taehyung.
it’s unmistakably him, held up by the armpits by jungkook who is kneeling behind him and trying to haul him up.
wet black hair plastered to his forehead and the long lashes fanning against his cheeks, the sharp nose and the jaw, the lips and the neck and the shoulders and the chest.
the relief lasts only a moment however, because when yoongi’s eyes travel lower, he feels as if he’s been stabbed straight through the chest.
because where taehyung’s torso ends—where his legs should be— there are only two horrific stubs of limbs.
he doesn’t have legs.
yoongi falls forward on his palms as all air leaves him, and his mouth gasps and wheezes and then parts with an urge to scream.
but the scream gets strangled in his tight throat because even in the dark, yoongi sees when the lids of taehyung’s eyes slowly lift, and it feels like somebody's doused him in ice water.
taehyung's eyes flutter open and they first find namjoon who’s standing a few feet away from him, then jimin who is holding yoongi up from behind, and then finally, slowly, land on yoongi.
the room is dark, and yoongi’s heart is frozen stiff, but taehyung’s heavy eyes stay on him as his mouth parts and trembles slightly, the whispered words leaving his dry lips like a wisp of smoke.
"i...want to die."
the tournament is truly to nobody’s liking, but yoongi’s father is rigid about following tradition and yoongi knows better than to get in the way of that.
it is customary in their ancestry that alphas prove their worth as a mate to an omega before the two of them are joined in matrimony.
seokjin, yoongi’s only older sibling, was the only exception.
as the one who’ll inherit the duke’s title, seokjin’s match had more to do with political gains than courting sports, but from what yoongi’s seen of the two of them in the past few years, seokjin and namjoon only seem to be partly joined by doctrine.
jimin, yoongi’s other sibling and an omega like him, is a whole lot more combative in his intentions.
their father would have to be blind to not see how taken he was with his guard and knight, jung hoseok.
but as it was, there had been not a cause to worry because hoseok easily bested his opponents and won jimin’s hand in a marriage that couldn’t be challenged by anybody.
yoongi, however, had a fate like neither of them.
his previous marriage had been a political one, perhaps the most talked about match that season.
the season’s diamond, they’d called him for catching the eye of the prince and securing his hand in marriage in just a month’s time.
but just a year after their courtship, yoongi found himself the prime subject of the ton’s gossip once again.
nothing enraptures them quite like the news of a widowed omega or one with child.
and yoongi was both.
jungkook is four now, sat giggling in jimin’s lap on yoongi’s right, probably the only one excited about the entire ordeal.
"anybody caught your eye?"
jimin leans to the side and whispers in yoongi’s ear, hidden behind the shade of yoongi’s fan.
yoongi would roll his eyes, but jimin is sincere.
as is everybody in his family.
nothing but concerned and genuine.
and yoongi wonders what they’d think if they knew the truth.
the thought makes him almost laugh out loud and he conceals it with his fan, bringing it up to the bridge of his nose till only his eyes are visible to everyone in the audience.
the truth is, yoongi couldn’t care less about any of the alphas standing in the ring below him, baring their chests and flexing their muscles for yoongi to see.
there aren’t as many of them as there had been before.
he’d have to be blind to not notice the stark difference in the numbers of the competitors in the previous tournament held for him and this one.
nobody wants "used goods" after all.
it might’ve angered him in the past, but the yoongi of now, four years into having jungkook, can hardly gather sufficient energy to care.
jimin is the one who’s ready to gut the gossip mongers at any social event that they attend, fiercely protective as he is of yoongi, and yoongi can’t help the fondness he feels at the thought of somebody else being angry on his behalf.
"they all look the same," yoongi answers once his eyes do a cursory sweep of the men lined up to fight for his hand in marriage.
it is the truth.
once they reach a certain size, all alphas look the same to him, blurring together till they’re all just sweaty chests, leery eyes, and pea-brained conversations.
jimin snorts as he leans away.
"you’re so pricey."
from the corner of his eye, yoongi sees fingers wrap around jimin’s neck from behind and give it a tight reproachful squeeze.
"as he should be," seokjin says as he sweeps into the chair to yoongi’s left, "and as is his right."
and then with a meaningful look in yoongi’s direction.
"the event is organised to give him options, not to have him settle."
yoongi smiles, feeling at ease with both of them by his side.
he knows most omegas don’t get this privilege.
hardly any omega gets to remarry once widowed.
and certainly none of them get to have their pick.
yoongi is fortunate.
he knows none of the contenders are here for him.
he is not foolish enough to believe that.
he’s just fortunate enough to be the brother to the future duke, and that gets him a decent number of suitors who would marry him despite the fact that yoongi has a child from another alpha.
not that he has to marry anybody.
seokjin and jimin had made sure of that.
he could reject every alpha present here, and that perhaps is his only respite in the entire evening.
it is what he expects too.
yoongi has no intention of marrying anybody here, or anybody ever.
he appreciates what everybody is doing for him, what his family is doing for him, but it is hard for him to tell them that it isn’t just about him spending his heats alone.
it’s not just about the terrible loneliness he carries in his chest, like one of these nights it’ll come crawling up to his throat and throttle him in his sleep.
it is no longer just yoongi.
it’s yoongi and jungkook, and yoongi is not looking for a partner for himself.
if he’s going to invite an alpha into his life, they’re going to have to be good enough for jungkook too.
and in yoongi’s honest opinion, nobody is ever going to be good enough for jungkook.
definitely none of these knot-headed alphas who think flexing their biceps in yoongi’s face would earn them his favor.
yoongi’s father finally makes a stand, and everyone in the stadium sits straighter.
yoongi slumps further back into his seat, wholly uninterested in the entire unnecessary protocol.
he’s seen it once before and has no desire to go through it again, but jimin pinches his skin when the duke waves a hand and gestures towards the competitors.
the first suitor steps forward, bowing first before the duke and then turning and taking a few steps towards yoongi before kneeling on the ground in front of him.
seokjin glances at yoongi, and yoongi sighs before nodding in resignation.
seokjin makes an acceding gesture, allowing the man to rise.
the alpha introduces himself, a name that yoongi can’t recall moments after he hears it.
he supposes the alpha could be called handsome, built large and stance strong, confidence visibly thrumming through his veins.
seokjin nods in yoongi’s stead, and the alpha steps forward to present his offering.
it’s an alexandrite gemstone cushioned inside an embroidered box.
the stone is rare and highly sought after, and yoongi is almost impressed until the man opens his mouth and goes on a long spiel likening yoongi’s beauty to the rarity of the stone, and yoongi has to remind himself of jungkook’s company to keep from swearing out loud.
jimin takes the offered stone, and he and yoongi share a look where yoongi very clearly shakes his head behind his fan.
jimin takes the gift back from jungkook’s small curious hands and returns it to the alpha.
much to yoongi’s annoyance, the alpha doesn’t seem fazed and simply bows at the waist and promises to win yoongi’s heart during the tournament.
the tiring ordeal continues, competitor after competitor, and towards the end of it yoongi is slumped fully in his chair, entirely exhausted and irritated.
jungkook is the only one who seems to be having fun, ooh-ing and ahh-ing at all the gifts he examines with his tiny hands and big rabbit-like eyes.
even jimin looks unimpressed with the suitors so far.
the gifts that followed the first were hardly different from it, all of them some variation of a gem or an ornament.
yoongi is close to dropping the polite interest he’s been feigning the entire evening when there’s a faint noise in the distance.
yoongi looks at the gate barring the entrance into the stadium, but from where he's seated, he cannot tell the cause behind the commotion.
there is some murmuring amongst the guards, one of them scurrying to the duke who’s seated on the platform not far away from yoongi, and yoongi’s father makes an acceding gesture.
with his permission, the guards eventually part and yoongi discerns the figure of a man approaching the competitors that are gathered on the side of the field.
he’s carrying what appears to be a wooden crate in his arms, and as he draws closer, yoongi can tell that he’s no nobility.
dressed in commoners’ clothes, the alpha stands out from the rest of the crowd.
commoners are permitted to participate in courting events, but a commoner marrying into nobility is almost unheard of.
yoongi is quite sure he’s never heard of a match like that.
a story of somebody choosing to marry below their station instead of above would definitely make its way around the ton for months to come.
but as the alpha comes closer, all traces of disinterest vanish from yoongi’s mind.
his stomach twists with a sudden horrifying wave of dread when he spots a familiar mop of black unruly hair, golden tan skin, eyes bright like stars and a mouth twisted into a shy smile.
the alpha stops to bow before the duke who regards him with feigned interest.
yoongi's fan falls from his fingers and into his lap, revealing his face to the crowd for the first time, and he feels jimin’s eyes on him, but yoongi doesn’t look at him.
his gaze is pinned to the man who turns to face him, and when their eyes meet for the first time, yoongi’s lips part unbidden.
"taehyung," he whispers, loud enough to have both seokjin and jimin’s heads twisting around to look at him in surprise.
taehyung smiles at yoongi hesitantly before he drops down to his knees before him.
"you know him?"
jimin hisses into his ear.
yoongi sees seokjin glance at him in question, but yoongi doesn't meet either of their eyes.
this time, he lifts his own hand and twists his wrist, beckoning towards taehyung with a finger, ordering him to stand up.
"kim taehyung," taehyung says once he’s upright and his eyes are fixed onto yoongi’s.
his voice is deep and rich, and if yoongi hadn't known him like he did, he might have missed the slight quiver of uncertainty behind it, but he can hear it just as well as he can see the way taehyung holds his present for yoongi close to his chest, as if embarrassed to offer it to him.
he doesn’t have a choice in the matter though because seokjin gestures at him to present it, and taehyung takes a moment to close his eyes before he pulls them open and takes in a visible steadying breath.
he presents the gift to jimin, and yoongi leans forward to take a look at what’s inside the wooden box.
the sight has him pulling in a quick sharp breath.
"tangerines," yoongi says, and when he looks down at taehyung, the alpha looks visibly nervous.
he rubs the back of his neck and suddenly seems unable to meet yoongi’s eyes.
"i noticed that you liked them, your grace," he says softly, "you always visited the gardens to pick them.
i grew these ones myself.
they’re fresh and ripe.
even if you don’t permit me to court you, i thought you should still be able to enjoy them."
he falls silent, and yoongi can feel everyone’s gaze on him.
he stares at the crate full of orange fruit, feeling a storm brewing inside his chest.
nobody in the stadium realises just how truly dangerous taehyung is to yoongi, and yoongi is frozen where he sits, unable to grasp what he should do.
he never expected to see taehyung again, and for a moment, yoongi feels the familiar constriction in his chest, like something is squeezing his windpipe and he cannot breathe.
in just a few moments, it feels as if the past four years didn’t occur and yoongi is transported back in time and— the spell is broken when jungkook tugs at yoongi’s sleeve, and yoongi looks up at his son in bewilderment and then at the rest of the crowd watching him.
he tightens his grip around the box and remembers where he is and what he is and nods, unable to trust himself to speak or meet taehyung’s eyes.
it takes jimin a moment to recover from his shock, and when he makes yoongi’s acceptance of the gift known to all, the entire stadium erupts in whispers.
from the corner of his eye, yoongi sees taehyung joining the other competitors, and when jimin whips his head to stare at him in bewilderment, yoongi shrinks into his seat.
"how do you know him?"
it is seokjin who speaks the question, and yoongi closes his eyes and reigns in whatever emotion is visible on his face.
it is of no use, he knows it.
seokjin has always been able to see right through him, and there’s never been any reason to hide anything from him.
until now.
"he was a gardener back at the palace," yoongi says.
it is hardly an explanation, and both of them know it.
for yoongi to remember taehyung’s name and recognise him on sight is incriminating enough, but thankfully seokjin and jimin don’t push any further.
yoongi sees them share a look when they think he isn’t looking, but he lets them go at it.
whatever they’re imagining won’t come anywhere close to the truth.
the truth is—the truth is that yoongi didn’t lie.
taehyung was a gardener, well he was really just an apprentice of one, unimportant enough to go unnoticed by the officials in the court, but that just made him all the more perfect for yoongi.
yoongi had visited the gardens for the first time with the prince.
the gardens themselves didn’t hold anything of interest to him, but he had spotted taehyung working on a few pots quietly in a corner.
the man was an alpha, it had been obvious even amidst all the scents of the flowers, but he was quiet, and the combination had seemed almost humorous to yoongi at the time.
he never thought he’d see those two traits coexist together.
it was a comical musing, a small one at the time, one that didn’t grow any further until months later.
months later, yoongi visited the gardens again.
taehyung was hard to find amidst all the plants, but yoongi found him.
and this time his visit held a much larger purpose.
he’d gained a considerable amount of knowledge about the plants they grew in the gardens since his first visit, but he’d pretended to be clueless about them anyway and had asked taehyung to teach their names to him.
taehyung was easy to fluster and eager to please, and as yoongi’s visits to the garden grew, taehyung’s feelings for him grew all the more apparent.
it was endearing, and made him even more perfect for the job, because when one year into his marriage and seven months into his pregnancy yoongi asked taehyung to grow the poison ivy in the garden, taehyung had taken one look at the fading bruises of fingers encircling yoongi’s throat and had done it without a singular sound of protest.
but now as yoongi watches him enter the ring full of posturing alphas, he feels as if he’s about to watch his life collapse and combust into flaming dust.
it makes no sense for taehyung to come here after all these years and attempt to court him.
he must know by now that yoongi only used him as a means to his own ends, and the more yoongi thinks about it, the less sense it makes.
taehyung should despise him, and for a brief second, yoongi thinks that must be it.
taehyung must be here to blackmail and extort him with the truth that only he knows.
but then he recalls taehyung’s hesitant smile when he presented him with his gift.
tangerines.
a lump makes itself known in yoongi’s tight throat, but he forcefully swallows it down.
deep down, he already knows what he wants.
it would be foolish to deny it when he cannot even bring himself to tear his eyes away from taehyung’s body as the alpha shakes out his arms and legs in order to prepare for combat.
he feels jimin’s eyes on him, but yoongi resolutely doesn’t meet them.
once the offerings are complete, most of the suitors looking disgruntled when yoongi accepts no gifts presented to him after taehyung’s, the duke rises from his seat to begin the tournament at last.
taehyung isn’t in the first dueling pair, and yoongi can’t decide if he’s disappointed or relieved.
"don’t," jimin warns him under his breath, and yoongi crushes his fingers into fists in his lap.
"he might not win."
he knows that.
if taehyung was nobility, it wouldn’t matter.
the tournament is more a traditional formality than anything else.
but jimin is right.
the only reason hoseok and he are where they are is because hoseok single-handedly slammed all of his opponents down on the floor in front of everybody and effectively sealed their mouths shut.
and hoseok was a knight, not born nobility but still high enough on the ladder to be respected in social circles.
taehyung is a gardener.
there is a gorge of a social strata between him and the others.
hoseok was trained in the military, but yoongi has never seen taehyung fight or show even a tint of aggression in their time together.
he is an alpha, yoongi holds no doubt about that.
he has seen him work in the gardens, lifting heavy pots from one corner to the other, but plain physical strength and actual hand-to-hand combat that requires years of technical training and skill are two entirely separate matters.
yoongi hardly pays attention to the first duel, only making note of the winner so he can gauge how taehyung might fare against him if they are pitted against each other.
he feels on edge, heart hammering against his ribs each time his father rises to announce the next two contenders to engage in combat.
he knows he’s being unreasonable.
he’s long since recognised his feelings, but things are different now.
four years have passed since they last saw one another, and the man in front of him is no longer the taehyung who’d blush as easily as a rose just from the touch of yoongi’s gaze on him.
the man before him has long since learnt of yoongi’s intentions and recognised him for what he is.
but none of that is able to keep yoongi’s eyes away from him, or stop his heart from threatening to have him fall out of his seat when taehyung’s name is called out for the third duel.
it is jimin who has to press yoongi into his seat, fingers digging into the flesh of yoongi’s arm in warning.
"show some restraint," he hisses, and yoongi grits his teeth but obeys.
taehyung has to fight an alpha yoongi has never favoured, and the entire stadium must be able to hear the way yoongi’s heart thrashes against his chest, a lot more honest than he’s ever been.
but the fates must be ridiculing him, because it is not a moment into the match when all of yoongi’s initial presumptions about taehyung’s fighting prowess are proven wrong all at once.
taehyung’s opponent charges at him with the force of a bull, but taehyung side-steps him easily and using the alpha’s own momentum against him, throws him into the mud headfirst.
the crowds gasp with surprise, and yoongi holds his breath as taehyung easily beats the alpha with little to no effort.
he is smart, yoongi realises with a dawning sense of dread, and the match is over almost as soon as it began with taehyung barely out of breath and his opponent trapped to the floor with his wrists bound behind his back and taehyung’s knee digging into his spine.
when his victory is announced, taehyung stands back up and turns to where yoongi is seated on the platform, and yoongi freezes when their eyes catch.
taehyung smiles at him and dips his head slightly as if in reverence.
yoongi slumps back into his chair, dumbfounded.
the duels continue, and yoongi hides his face behind his fan once again because jimin and seokjin appear to have dropped whatever reservations they held about taehyung, having taken to finding amusement in the hue of yoongi’s cheeks instead each time taehyung enters the ring.
namjoon joins them just before the final few rounds begin and only a handful of alphas are left to compete further into the tournament.
"what did i miss?"
he asks as he comes to stand behind seokjin’s seat, bending down to press a kiss into his hair.
"yoongi wants to jump the commoner," jimin informs him, and yoongi would smack him if they weren’t in public.
namjoon’s eyes widen for a brief moment before his face breaks into a dimpled smile, and the alpha looks back at yoongi with a sincerity only he can manage.
"well, for your sake, hyung, i hope he wins."
despite what it may look like now, yoongi knows that it took a long time for namjoon and seokjin to reach where they are.
manufactured marriages rarely ever work out like theirs, yoongi knows it from experience, and he turns and looks back at taehyung, surprised to find taehyung watching him as well.
taehyung smiles at him, and for a moment yoongi stiffens in his seat, but then he looks away, unable to meet the alpha’s gaze without the guilt churning afresh in the pit of his belly.
the rest of the tournament passes like a blur in yoongi’s eyes.
save for taehyung’s matches, he couldn’t care less about who wins or loses.
taehyung gains his next two wins easily; the third one, taehyung’s fourth fight, is harder, and yoongi can see the exhaustion clearly from the curve of his back.
he doesn’t give his opponent any opportunity to get him, but yoongi can tell the continuous matches are tiring him out and each consequent duel has been longer than the one before it.
"he’s good."
even hoseok sounds impressed from where he’s been watching the matches silently.
he’d joined them in time to catch the last few matches of the round, and yoongi can see him assessing all the contenders with a skilled eye.
"certainly trained, and i don’t just mean his body.
he’s been observing everybody from the sidelines, picking up on their tells and using them against them in the matches."
taehyung wins his fifth bout, which puts him in the final round but also gives him no time to recuperate.
he’s panting and bleeding from the mouth, a stray punch from his previous opponent that taehyung was too slow to dodge, but he wipes it with his fist and bends at the knees as his final opponent enters the ring.
it’s the suitor who’d introduced himself first, and yoongi can make out his confident grin even from this distance.
he’s bigger than taehyung, muscles prominent and trained in a way that gives him a leverage over taehyung in all the important ways when it comes to hand-to-hand combat, and despite taehyung proving him wrong on every account, yoongi feels fearful for him anyway.
he knows now that taehyung is nothing like the man he left behind in the palace gardens four years ago without a word of a warning or goodbye, but his heart clenches into itself anyway, uncaring of the four years of distance between them.
the crowd has hushed into silence, anticipatory of the match between the final contenders.
and taehyung stands still, letting his pants ease into something quieter as he waits for the commencement of the bout.
when it comes, the duke’s roaring voice drowns out the noise from the alpha’s sprinting charge, and yoongi’s mouth parts in a pained gasp when taehyung spins to dodge it but catches a graze of the attack on his forearm.
it is obvious that his opponent’s energy hasn’t flagged from his previous matches, but taehyung is certainly slower than before.
by the time he goes to parry the second attack, his opponent is already in the middle of his strike, and taehyung catches it on the meat of his thigh.
he falls back to try to further the distance between them, but his opponent is relentless, closing the distance between them again in no time, and for his part, taehyung doesn’t stop moving.
he’s mostly defensive, focused entirely on sliding away from the critical hits and catching others in places that wouldn’t be fatal.
the crowd groans each time taehyung rolls out of the range of an attack, and yoongi curls his fingers into the fabric of his robes.
just a few hours prior to the tournament, yoongi couldn’t have cared less about who won it.
he wouldn’t have permitted them or anybody else to court him.
but now, with each blow that bruises taehyung’s skin, yoongi feels like he is the one who bears it.
after a while, it is evident that the ruthless brutal blocking is tiring taehyung out as well.
the alpha is cornering him, and taehyung is falling back just as easily.
they’re at least twenty meters from where they started, almost at the edge of the boundary, and taehyung must know it too because he pauses for one precarious moment when he’s close to the edge of the ring, and the alpha sees it.
it is a tempting target, and yoongi has to clench his teeth from crying out when the alpha goes in for the attack.
except, something unexpected happens, and the alpha loses his footing when he’s spinning for a powerful kick aimed at taehyung’s temple.
"oh, he’s good," hoseok whistles just as taehyung moves with an unprecedented speed, ducking easily to dodge the kick and landing a hit at the back of the alpha’s legs that has the alpha falling forward on his knees.
when yoongi tears his eyes from the match and glances at hoseok, the knight is grinning and leaning forward to watch the arena with an eagerness he didn’t display for any of the prior matches.
"he’s been observing the terrain," hoseok explains, and yoongi doesn’t understand until he leans forward and catches how the terrain is rougher around the edges of the ring where taehyung and his opponent now stand.
"he’s been falling back to lead them both there."
it’s almost as if everything yoongi saw before this was a facade.
taehyung’s movements are fierce and fast now, nothing like what they’d been at the beginning of the bout.
he moves with precision and a dogged determination, and his opponent can only block the worst of the attacks as he lies twisted on the ground below him.
the match comes to a close after a few minutes when taehyung twists the alpha’s arms behind him with a very real threat of pulling them off him, and the alpha frantically taps out but taehyung doesn’t let go of him until he meets the eyes of everybody in the audience, as if silently daring them to challenge his victory.
the stadium is silent when taehyung finally lets go of the man.
yoongi watches him stagger upright, arms almost hanging off his shoulders and body bleeding from at least four different places.
if yoongi’s father is disappointed with the outcome of the tournament, he doesn’t show it.
he rises from his seat, and everyone follows him as he walks to the front of the platform.
"the winner of this tournament, kim taehyung!"
the crowd cheers, and taehyung folds himself into a bow before the duke once again.
"yoongi, do you permit this man to court—" his father is turning around to face him with expectation, but yoongi has already torn jimin’s hand from his arm and is leaping off the platform without a single thought or care.
the stadium bursts into an eruption of whispers at the spectacle as yoongi sprints across the field towards taehyung, but he can’t bring himself to care, and when taehyung lifts his head to look at him, yoongi’s legs can’t hold him.
they tremble and drop him to his knees.
"your grace," taehyung says, lips trembling into a smile when yoongi cups his bloodied face in his palms, and yoongi’s heart clenches with a pain all too familiar.
his throat feels so tight, but he twists his head and barks at the guards.
"bring a healer!
quickly!"
it doesn’t take long before attendants arrive to inspect taehyung’s wounds, and after confirming some bruised ribs and a dislocated shoulder, they begin to take him away to the healers.
yoongi starts to follow them, but seokjin holds him back and yoongi grudgingly obeys, knowing better than to make a scene bigger than he already has.
his father gives him a look that certainly means that they’re going to have a chat later in the day, and not long after, yoongi is escorted out of the stadium by jimin and his attendants.
he feels restless for the remaining day, the events of the day hitting him ten times as hard when he is forced to recall his time in the palace.
everything feels big and consequential, like all that he’s known to be his life for the past four years is going to be uprooted very soon, and yoongi feels so wholly unprepared for it all.
thankfully, seokjin and jimin let him be with his thoughts for the rest of the day, and he sits jungkook down and talks to him, but it is truly taehyung who he needs to speak with.
they would meet the next day, but yoongi knows that they won’t get the privacy he needs then.
so when the dark descends and everyone retires to their rooms after the last meal, yoongi leaves jungkook with jimin and slips into the hallway barefoot, careful to not make a noise that would alert the guards.
finding taehyung is not a problem.
yoongi hasn’t been able to smell anything but his scent for the entire day.
it is quite a walk from yoongi’s own rooms, but once he stands before the doors to the quarters given to taehyung, yoongi knocks his knuckles against the wood twice and doesn’t wait for a response before he slips past them.
taehyung’s lying on a bed, his face turned to the side where the curtains are tugged back to reveal a wide window that oversees the vast gardens around the house.
he must not have expected his visitor to be yoongi because he leaps up at the sight of him and then winces at the quick movement, one hand coming up to grab at his bandaged side.
yoongi almost surges forward to help him but then remembers his place a moment later.
he remains where he is with his hands in the air like he doesn’t know what to do with himself, frozen in his uncertainty about where the two of them stand.
taehyung lifts his head to meet his eyes, and they hold the contact for a long time, but when yoongi doesn’t make a motion to move, taehyung smiles and gestures at him to come closer, delicately shifting and making space for yoongi to sit at the edge of the bed.
yoongi bites his lip and occupies the offered seat, and for a long moment the two of them watch each other in silence.
there is white gauze where his wounds were, and his hair is no longer matted with sweat and blood.
taehyung looks almost younger under the warm glow of the oil lamp kept on the nightstand beside the bed, his features softer and the shadows in his eyes not as dark as they’d been when he stood in the bloody arena, daring anybody to challenge his worth.
"how are you feeling?"
yoongi asks him softly.
the yellow light makes everything feel like a dream, and yoongi fears that speaking any louder would somehow rip the reverie from its seams.
"it looks a lot worse than it feels," taehyung assures him, face losing some of its tension, and one of his hands comes to rest over yoongi’s.
they fall into silence once again.
taehyung seems to be searching yoongi’s face for something, but yoongi has never felt more unaware of what he’s thinking.
"i’m glad," taehyung speaks into the silence between them all of a sudden, lips stretched into a sad smile that yoongi doesn’t understand.
"what?"
"to know that you care," taehyung says and yoongi feels his throat go dry.
he watches taehyung tip his head back against the wall and stare up at the ceiling.
"i spent years thinking..."
there’s an unmistakable quiver in taehyung’s voice as it grows the slightest bit wetter, and yoongi feels the lump in his own throat grow as taehyung blinks back obvious tears.
"i’m just glad that it wasn’t all a lie.
you care.
that’s good to know."
the guilt comes flooding back all at once, and yoongi struggles to breathe as it threatens to drown him.
"of course—" he stutters, crushing his robes in his fists, "of course i care, you—i—" he trails off, suddenly at a loss for words, not knowing what to say other than the obvious.
i’m sorry.
taehyung smiles but doesn’t say anything.
he continues to watch the ceiling, and yoongi doesn’t know what they’re doing.
"why are you here, taehyung?"
he asks him finally after a minute of neither of them saying a word.
taehyung looks at him again, but instead of answering, he asks, "don’t you want to know what i did in the last four years?"
he doesn’t seem to be waiting for yoongi’s response because he’s speaking again.
"i left the palace.
soon after you did.
i waited at first.
i thought you’d come back."
taehyung laughs, and yoongi wants to do anything but.
he digs his nails into his palms till the flesh is carved with crescents.
"well, at some point i realised that you weren’t going to.
and that they’d come for me instead.
so i fled the gardens and joined the military."
"wait, what—" "everybody told me i wasn’t cut out for it," taehyung goes on without stopping.
he’s smiling but it’s so obviously forced, lips stretched so tight, yoongi almost cannot recognise the taehyung before him.
"they were right.
i wasn’t.
you always said i was too soft for an alpha.
and at first, i think i was still trying to become somebody you wouldn’t leave behind.
i thought that perhaps if i wasn’t so weak, if i’d stepped up sooner to help you—" "taehyung-ah, no."
yoongi feels frantic.
"that’s not—me leaving had nothing to do with you."
"what was it about then?"
taehyung cuts in.
there’s a hardness to his face, and yoongi realises that this is the taehyung of the past four years.
the taehyung that he knew was starry eyes and sweet giggles, fantasies of bunnies on the moon and a fondness for strawberries and the cakes yoongi would steal from the kitchens for him.
"why did you leave me behind?"
taehyung asks him, blunt and unapologetic.
"you asked me why i’m here.
this is the reason.
i want to know.
after you left, i struggled to tell what was real between us and what wasn’t.
some days i was bitter, angry at myself for having deluded myself into believing some nobility would be interested in me.
a gardener!"
taehyung laughs, a sound so bitter and humorless, yoongi’s heart breaks.
"the other days i convinced myself that it couldn’t all be a farce.
so please tell me the truth, your grace, and put me out of my misery."
"i—" the words grate at his throat.
shame and guilt try to twist his tongue, but it’s been four years and there’s nobody right now who deserves his honesty any more than taehyung does.
"i was scared."
the surprise softens taehyung’s face, but yoongi trudges on, the words so honest they feel foreign on his tongue.
"i had jungkook and i could no longer trust anybody besides myself.
i was scared they’d find out, and i—i shouldn’t have left you like that.
i know, fuck i knew even then, and i wanted to go back, so many times and so much.
but i couldn’t bring myself to do it or to confront you.
i knew you’d hate me for what i did, and i—i was scared."
he feels his voice waver, and yoongi looks at his lap when the heat behind his eyes doesn’t disappear even when yoongi tries to blink it back.
"i’m sorry."
he doesn’t know what expression taehyung is wearing and finds himself too scared to find out.
he startles when he feels fingers on his chin, forcing him to look up at taehyung.
"i don’t hate you," taehyung says, and yoongi is startled out of his thoughts when taehyung pulls him closer by the chin he has trapped between his fingers.
"i love you."
the words are uttered like a breath, a soft inhale, and yoongi is frozen where taehyung has brought their faces so close together, it’s impossible to not see the sincerity that softens his eyes.
"that’s why i came here today.
to get a chance to tell you what i couldn’t then."
there’s no way taehyung can’t hear yoongi’s heart thrashing wildly inside his chest.
"taehyung—" "i don’t expect anything.
more than anything, i just regretted not telling you how i felt.
i understand why you left, and it’s been four years so it’s really—" yoongi grabs him by the neck and pulls him in sharply, colliding their mouths together in a kiss that is more violent than anything else.
he feels taehyung’s mouth part in shock, but yoongi presses harder, and then taehyung is kissing him back, just as hard.
the kiss isn’t deep, but they remain pressed together for long, and yoongi is panting when they finally part for air.
"was that sufficient, or do you need further proof of my feelings?"
he asks him, and isn’t surprised at all when taehyung grins.
"no, i don’t think i am entirely convinced—" and they’re kissing once again, but it’s difficult when they’re both smiling into it.
later, they’d navigate to the bed and talk some more, about jungkook and about the lives they spent apart, and taehyung would bring yoongi’s knuckles to his lips and ask, min yoongi, would you let me into your life again and do me the honor of letting me court you?
and yoongi would say yes in a heartbeat.
yoongi jerks awake to the sound of the door to their apartment clicking shut.
he blinks several times before his eyes make out the dark blurry shape that is taehyung toeing off his shoes at the entrance.
"you didn't go to sleep?"
taehyung asks as he walks to the switchboard and flicks a light on.
yoongi buries his face further into the cushion, making an unintelligible sound and flapping one hand in the air in some vague gesture to tell taehyung to turn it off.
taehyung laughs from somewhere deep in his chest and does as requested.
"better?"
he murmurs, much closer now that he's taken a seat beside yoongi on the couch.
yoongi pulls himself upright, giving a sleepy deep-throated affirmation as he bends forward to pick his phone from the coffee table and look at the time because he has no recollection of falling asleep.
the anime he’d put on looks completely foreign now, well past the episode yoongi had been watching.
11:45 yoongi squints at the screen before his eyes grow wide, and he twists to look at taehyung who's leaning back against the couch in an attempt to stretch his spine.
"it's almost twelve.
what happened?"
"we had to revise the proposal thrice, and when we finished the guys at the office wanted to get some drinks, and after that i don't know."
taehyung pauses to groan once he starts to rotate his shoulder to relieve some of the stiffness there, undoubtedly a result of driving for long.
they’ve been looking for apartments closer to taehyung’s office that won’t be far from yoongi’s workplace either, but neither of them have been satisfied with the options so far.
"you remember mingyu?"
taehyung turns to look at him, and yoongi struggles to recall the face of taehyung's colleague.
"we had dinner at his place a few months ago?
anyway, he was drunk so i had to drive his car back home, and then i had to come pick my own from the office and it was a mess."
yoongi taps on the messaging app and brings the screen close to his nose as he reads the texts taehyung sent him, all of them spaced out by an hour.
> hey, work will go on for long.
i'll probably eat before i come back.
don't stay up.
> me and a couple of guys from office are getting drinks.
i'll come home by 10.
> i'm sorry, it's gonna take longer :< go to sleep, okay?
i'll be home soon.
"you should've gone to bed," taehyung tells him, and yoongi looks away from his phone to see taehyung peeling his jacket off his shoulders.
when he begins to undo the first few buttons of his shirt and cuffs, yoongi has to thank the dark because twelve months into their marriage and he still feels his cheeks warm at the sight of his husband undressing in front of him.
"did you eat?"
yoongi asks him, trying to ignore the heat spreading across his face.
there's so much skin, obviously, because taehyung has skin.
it’d be more alarming if he didn't.
"i had pasta.
did you eat?"
taehyung shifts slightly to face yoongi, and the movement causes their thighs to touch.
there's a suspicious lilt in his voice which would offend yoongi if it wasn’t a well-established fact that yoongi is awful at keeping to his mealtimes.
he’d munched on some tortilla chips while he worked (which was almost five hours ago?) but taehyung doesn't need to know that.
"i ate," he says and rolls his eyes for good measure.
taehyung hums and doesn't sound like he believes him.
yoongi can only hope that he doesn't spot the packet of doritos in the dark.
for a while, both of them are quiet.
but it isn’t uncomfortable like it used to be a few months ago.
yoongi is watching the anime on mute, absently thinking about the new development project he'd taken on the week before when taehyung breaks the silence again.
"did you hear from my mother?"
he asks, and he sounds exhausted.
"about the anniversary celebration?
mom initially wanted to do an exclusive interview with us and close family.
i managed to convince her out of it thankfully, but she wants to invite the press to the event instead and she won’t budge."
yoongi hums a vague affirmative as he picks up the remote and switches off the television, unable to tell what’s going on in the anime anymore.
he’d gotten a call from taehyung’s mother earlier in the day.
"she wants to meet us for lunch on sunday," he tells taehyung because she’d specifically instructed yoongi to.
taehyung groans again, and yoongi hears him run a hand through his hair and push it off his forehead.
"like she couldn’t tell me herself," he mutters and yoongi side-eyes him.
they both know that she always approaches yoongi because he has little choices in these matters.
"anyway, we can deal with that on sunday itself," taehyung says in resignation.
"i’m going to take a shower before i pass out on this couch and crack my spine open."
without his contacts and in the absence of the light from the television, yoongi finds it difficult to discern taehyung’s movements in the dark.
he registers taehyung picking himself off the couch and grabbing his jacket before his husband braces a palm on the backrest behind yoongi’s head and dips down low to close the distance between yoongi and himself.
it’s a thing they have.
neither of them have acknowledged it or given it a name, but it began during the countless company dinners and family gatherings where they were needed to pretend like they were a newly married couple very much in love with each other despite having met only a few weeks before.
it had been awkward the first few times, but they quickly grew familiar with the routine.
taehyung would wrap an arm around yoongi’s waist, and yoongi would curl into him and smile, gums and everything.
they’d laugh.
taehyung would lean down and yoongi would whisper something sarcastic in his ear.
it’d make taehyung giggle.
and then sometimes, when they’d feel eyes on them, taehyung would slant his head and kiss yoongi’s cheek briefly.
the shutters would go off around them, and taehyung’s parents would smile and nod at yoongi in approval.
but no one could tell just how hard yoongi's heart would thrash against his chest each time it happened.
it went on like that for months, and in the whirlwind of cocktail parties and charity events, before yoongi could wrap his head around it, it became a thing.
even in the absence of the camera lenses and their family’s threatening eyes, taehyung grew more open with his affection.
the kisses never strayed from yoongi’s cheek, but taehyung never failed to press them against his skin and whisper goodnight each night before they separated into their individual bedrooms.
except it’s dark, and yoongi can’t tell how taehyung is oriented.
he twists his face to the left, just a little, to see taehyung better, but the movement brings their lips together by accident and both of them freeze stiff in the moment.
it’s not even a kiss.
their lips are barely grazing, but they’re close enough for yoongi to feel taehyung’s breaths against his mouth.
and he feels time slow down unnaturally.
the entire apartment is silent save for the sounds of their quiet breathing, and yoongi doesn’t know how long the two of them stay like that, but it feels like an entire eternity passes before taehyung whispers an apology and starts to pull himself away.
something in that moment suddenly feels horribly wrong, like if he doesn’t rectify it immediately, he may end up losing something he didn’t even know he had the chance of possessing.
and yoongi is not a reckless person by nature, but before he can consider what possesses him, he is reaching out and grabbing taehyung by the bicep, stopping him in his motion before he can pull away completely.
it’s dark but yoongi can tell that taehyung is staring at him, unmoving and with little distance between them.
and another long silence follows although this one is a lot less welcome.
yoongi feels like they’re standing at the edge of a cliff, and one of them is about to push the other into it.
but the moment comes to a halt when taehyung moves, and it’s like a giant tidal wave is about to crash into him because where taehyung had been supporting himself on his palm on the backrest, he now bends his arm by the elbow so that he’s leaning further into the couch and caging yoongi against it.
taehyung digs a knee into the couch and all at once he’s looming over yoongi, engulfing him before he dips down low once again and closes the distance between their mouths.
it’s just the press of their lips.
for a long moment, neither of them move, almost like they're waiting for the other to pull away.
but when yoongi doesn't shove him away, taehyung presses closer and carefully moves his lips against yoongi's.
like a machine slowly whirring to life, yoongi mirrors his movements, and the kiss eases from awkward to something marginally sweeter yet hesitant.
it’s closed lips and a whole lot of heavy silence, and taehyung pulls away after a few moments.
"we need to talk," he whispers.
yoongi meets his eyes.
talking is just about the last thing he wants to do at the moment.
"we can talk about it tomorrow," he whispers and slides his arms around taehyung’s neck, bringing him down so they’re close again, not kissing but breathing the same air.
yoongi watches taehyung lick his lips and consider it.
"okay," his husband finally whispers and leans forward, and they're kissing again.
this kiss is a lot less hesitant.
taehyung kisses yoongi like he does just about everything else, both confident and careful, and yoongi tightens his arms around taehyung’s neck, pulling him closer till taehyung is fully straddling him, his front pressed against yoongi’s and the slide of their mouths wet and urgent.
taehyung’s hands find yoongi’s waist, and yoongi absently thinks that he hears the sound of taehyung’s jacket falling on the floor.
he hopes they don’t step on it by accident, but any thought of that is instantly wiped from his mind when yoongi feels taehyung’s tongue swipe at his lip.
he nearly whines when he parts his lips and taehyung licks inside his mouth.
the sounds of their kissing, the little breathy gasps and moans are loud in the silence of their apartment, and yoongi doesn’t know how long they just kiss like that, but after a while the desperation eases and they kiss deeply but without the urgency from before.
and yoongi does whine when taehyung pulls away eventually.
"i’m going to shower," his husband rasps, voice rough and clearly out of breath.
"what?"
taehyung gently pulls away from yoongi, and yoongi releases his hold on taehyung’s neck, arms falling back on the couch in confusion.
"i’m going to shower," taehyung repeats gently and brings a knuckle to graze yoongi’s jaw, "and if this is something we both still want after we’ve had some time to clear our heads, then we can continue.
does that sound good?"
yoongi exhales, leaning back against the couch as he catches his breath.
"okay, sounds good," he says, and taehyung smiles and pecks him briefly on the cheek before he picks himself off yoongi and retreats to his room.
when the door clicks shut behind him, yoongi slumps back into the couch and wonders whether that was his husband’s polite way of dismissing him.
except when he retreats to his own room and stands under the stream of his shower, yoongi does admit that it’s a good thing taehyung stopped them when he did.
he mulls over the events of the night as he brushes his teeth and changes into a pair of light gray sweatpants and a white loose shirt with a stretched neckline that he suspects belongs to taehyung.
yoongi has known his feelings for taehyung for several months now.
his attraction was evident to himself on the very evening they met.
when taehyung sat across him in the restaurant their parents had arranged their meeting at, challenging yoongi’s cold stare with his own and looking every bit as handsome and daunting as yoongi had heard as he sipped his wine and raised an eyebrow at yoongi in question.
("your mother told me that you were enthusiastic about this arrangement, but i’m guessing that’s not the case?"
"you have impressive deduction skills, taehyung-ssi."
"i’ll take that as a no."
"it doesn’t matter.
i don’t have a choice in the matter.
what about you?
are you going to say yes?"
"do you want me to say yes?"
"i just said that it doesn’t matter.
if it’s not you, they’ll marry me off to somebody else."
"then i guess it doesn’t matter what i say, right?") taehyung had grinned wickedly at him, and yoongi had felt the heat flare behind his cheeks.
but he buried it under the storm of silent fury that had been brewing inside him.
the beginning of their relationship wasn’t smooth, not when yoongi was forced into the arrangement to solidify a merger with the kims.
and taehyung had been an easy target at the time.
his husband had been on the receiving end of most of yoongi’s scathing anger, and he’d taken it all, no matter what yoongi said to him, things that shame him to think about now.
but taehyung stood resilient against all of it, and before yoongi knew it, months had passed and he was tired of fighting what had lodged its roots in his heart and coiled its vines around his ribcage.
something that ran much, much deeper than the initial superficial attraction and only seemed to suffocate him the more he struggled against it.
yoongi finds taehyung’s room empty when he enters it, but then he hears the sound of water running in the bathroom.
he perches on what is technically their bed, but other than the few rare times someone from either of their friend circles spent the night, yoongi always sleeps in the guestroom.
it’s awkward because his presence in the room alone clearly indicates his answer, but he doesn’t know if taehyung feels the same.
after everything that’s happened between them, it’s inconceivable to yoongi why his husband would feel the same.
he wonders if he should leave before taehyung finds him.
for all he knows, it probably was a dismissal.
taehyung was too kind to let him down and tell him that he wasn’t interested.
but in the one year yoongi has spent with taehyung in close quarters, he's never known him to do something like that.
taehyung is kind, but he always says what he means.
he’s straightforward, and his honesty is his kindness.
the sound of the door opening startles yoongi out of his thoughts.
he’d been so lost in his head, he hadn’t noticed when the sound of running water was silenced.
taehyung is towelling his hair dry when he emerges from the bathroom, and he pauses once he spots yoongi on the bed.
yoongi’s eyes snap wide open.
taehyung’s not worn a shirt, and his pants hang low on his hips.
yoongi immediately darts his gaze back to taehyung’s face who is watching him with obvious surprise.
the silence stretches between them, and yoongi’s lips stiffly pull at a corner.
"you look surprised," he says, and something in his chest distinctly hardens.
yoongi laughs and pushes his hair off his forehead as he slowly stands back up from where he’d awkwardly been sitting on the edge of the bed.
"i suppose—i should leave, i’m sorry."
"no—" yoongi hasn’t even fully turned towards the door.
he stops and twists his neck to stare back at taehyung in confusion.
taehyung tosses his towel somewhere behind him before he takes four quick strides towards yoongi and grabs hold of his wrist.
"wait.
i was just surprised," taehyung says.
his eyes are wide, and yoongi sees his own uncertainty reflected in them.
"you don’t have to leave, not unless you want to leave obviously."
taehyung lets go of yoongi’s wrist quickly like the touch burnt him, and yoongi stares at him a little incredulously.
he slowly turns back around to face taehyung fully.
"i don’t want to leave," he says, as if it wasn’t obvious already.
"i don’t want you to leave either," taehyung says, and for a moment, both of them stare at each other, and almost simultaneously, they burst into disbelieving laughter.
it is absurd.
they’re about to enter their thirties, and they’re married, but yoongi still feels his heart kick inside his chest.
"okay," he answers, smiling.
taehyung bites his lip and breaks yoongi’s gaze when he looks at the floor between their feet.
he huffs out a laugh, probably realising himself that they’re acting like teenagers.
"can i kiss you?"
he asks and meets yoongi’s eyes again.
his hair has grown long enough for his damp bangs to hang in front of his eyes, and yoongi steps forward to brush them away.
taehyung watches him, eyes soft, and instead of a verbal response, yoongi curls an arm around taehyung’s neck and pulls him down to kiss him, smiling as he does.
taehyung’s hands come to hold him by the waist, pulling him closer, and suddenly it’s like they never stopped.
the kiss turns heated quickly.
yoongi moans into it and lets taehyung walk him back till he feels the back of his knees hit the edge of the bed.
taehyung pulls away to look at him.
"i don’t—" he starts, voice low and gravelly.
his lips are slick red and his breaths come out in pants.
"what do you want?"
he asks.
yoongi doesn’t permit himself to overthink it.
"lie down?"
he asks him, a palm on taehyung’s chest, and taehyung licks his lips and nods.
he climbs on the bed and twists around so he can scoot back till his head meets the headboard, and yoongi follows him, swinging a leg over his hips and straddling him.
he cracks a fond smile when he runs his palms across taehyung’s chest and feels his husband’s heart racing.
"come here," taehyung requests, and yoongi bends to meet him for a deep kiss.
taehyung’s hand comes to hold him by the nape of his neck.
he runs his fingers through the hair there, scratching the base of his scalp, and yoongi hums into the kiss.
he splays out his fingers on taehyung’s sternum and supports himself on it when he pulls away to ask, "can i suck you off?"
taehyung’s eyes grow wide.
"is that—" he swallows, "is that something you want to do?"
yoongi can’t help the roll of his eyes.
of course taehyung is like this in bed as well.
he’s always been so composed and careful, and yoongi can’t help the thrill that suddenly streaks down his spine at the thought of yanking that composure from him, to have his husband come apart underneath him.
"just lay back," he says instead, pushing taehyung back against the bed.
"i want you to be comfortable."
yoongi feels the way taehyung shivers under him when he bends down to kiss his stomach.
it makes him smile, and he bites down on the soft skin under his belly button, right above the waistband of his sweatpants, and taehyung gasps.
yoongi wants to tease him more, wants to kiss and mark his thighs and the back of his knees, but he’s not sure he can last long either.
he taps at taehyung’s hipbone with a finger, and taehyung lifts his hips to allow yoongi to slide his pants down his legs and toss them behind them on the floor.
taehyung isn’t wearing anything underneath, and for a moment yoongi stares at his cock and licks his lips.
he’s big, but nothing yoongi can’t handle.
he wraps a hand around it and looks up at taehyung who’s watching him with lidded hungry eyes.
without looking away, yoongi lowers himself onto his cock, wrapping his mouth over the head and licking at its tip.
the reaction is immediate.
taehyung arches up into him and squeezes his eyes shut as he groans, but yoongi pulls away from him.
"look at me," he says, and taehyung blinks his eyes back open to look at yoongi as if he’s in a daze even though yoongi’s barely touched him.
"i want you to watch me," yoongi repeats before he goes down on him again.
taehyung’s fingers fist the fabric of the sheets, and neither of them look away as yoongi slowly bobs his head up and down his length.
he goes deeper with every egress, and it’s an intimacy unlike any before.
taehyung watches him with dark eyes and a parted mouth, soft moans leaving him despite his attempts, and yoongi feels even more determined to make him come apart.
deep throating isn’t something he’s done in a while, obviously, since it’s been a year of living with his husband and pretending they’re roommates.
but it’s something he enjoyed doing in his college years, and perhaps yoongi wants to show off a little, but regardless of the reason, he slides his mouth further down till he feels taehyung’s cock hit the back of his throat.
he hears taehyung make a needy noise, and it only pushes him further.
he relaxes his throat and takes in more of taehyung till his nose is buried in the thick black hair at the base of taehyung’s cock.
"fuck," taehyung groans from somewhere deep inside his chest.
"i’m not—i’m not going to last long."
yoongi is nobody to judge.
he is so close to it himself just by sucking taehyung off.
he gently plays with taehyung’s balls with his hand, and taehyung’s hands tangle themselves in his hair.
he doesn’t pull at it, just rests them there, and yoongi is glad because he’s never liked his hair being pulled.
"yoongi, i’m not—shit," taehyung curses and lets his head fall back against the pillow.
he’s not holding back anymore, and he sounds so hot, voice deep and breaking around his words as yoongi swallows around him and slides up and down his length slowly.
it’s only a couple of minutes later when yoongi is teasingly curling his tongue around taehyung that he feels a gentle tug at his hair and taehyung cries out a warning.
yoongi draws back a little before taehyung trembles and spills inside his throat.
some of it escapes him, but yoongi manages to swallow the rest before he pulls off taehyung completely.
"come here, sweetheart, please," taehyung rasps out, fingers sliding down to hold yoongi’s face by his chin and pull him up for a kiss so sickeningly sweet after such a heated moment.
yoongi is caught by surprise when taehyung flips them around and suddenly it’s yoongi with his back pressed into the mattress.
"your turn," taehyung almost growls into the kiss, and yoongi feels his fingers skim down his chest to tug at the hem of his shirt and push it up to his chin.
yoongi shivers when the chilled air of the room suddenly hits his bare skin.
he watches taehyung sit back and look at him with heated eyes, taking him in slowly, and it has his skin breaking out in goosebumps.
yoongi lets his eyes skate over his husband’s broad chest, the delectable dip of his collar bones, his defined arms and his long fingers that are curved around yoongi’s waist.
almost reflexively, the feeling of self-consciousness rises to his throat.
the urge to shrink away from taehyung’s gaze grows, but yoongi forcibly swallows it down.
he spreads his legs wider and raises his arms in invitation, watching the way taehyung’s eyes darken with want.
the feeling of being so obviously wanted by his husband has his entire body trembling with anticipation.
"god," taehyung exhales, his eyes darting back to meet yoongi’s.
"you’re so sexy, baby."
yoongi’s breath hitches when taehyung dips low enough to swipe at yoongi’s hardened nipple with his tongue.
he gasps and arches into taehyung when his husband closes his mouth over the bud and gives it a hard suck.
yoongi grabs taehyung by the shoulders and digs his nails into the skin, to pull him closer or push him away, he doesn’t know.
he thrashes and falls back against the bed, kicking his legs uselessly as taehyung licks and sucks and nips at the bud relentlessly.
"so pink everywhere," taehyung says once he releases the reddened nipple after reducing yoongi to incoherency, and his hand snakes down to yoongi’s cock that’s hard and obvious under the thin cotton of his sweatpants.
"are you pink down here too?"
taehyung asks him, voice so low and sultry, yoongi shudders deep within.
he pants as he stares at the ceiling because looking at taehyung seems impossible at the moment.
each time he thinks taehyung can’t possibly overwhelm him anymore, he opens his mouth and says some shit like this that leaves him blindsided.
"take a look for yourself," yoongi rasps out and somehow manages to sound deadpan even though he feels utterly debauched.
taehyung is clearly taking his time to ruin him, and yoongi doesn’t know if he wants to whine and beg him to touch him or ram a knee into his crotch for being so utterly maddening.
but thankfully taehyung doesn’t waste anymore time after that.
he pulls down both yoongi’s sweatpants and his boxers to his thighs till his cock springs free, and yoongi doesn’t have to see to know the gleeful expression on his face.
he hides his face in his palms but taehyung laughs and tugs them away.
he kisses him once again, and it’s not as desperate this time.
it is deep and sensual, and taehyung’s mouth moves against his languidly, kissing his top lip and then his bottom, licking into him and smiling.
"my pretty pink yoongi," he teases, "even your cock is pretty.
you’re so unfair."
"you—ah you’re the one who’s being unfair," yoongi complains in between kisses.
taehyung hums in question like he’s oblivious to what yoongi could possibly be complaining about, and yoongi should’ve known he’s going to be like this.
"touch me already," he nearly whines, needy and absolutely fed up, and taehyung pulls away to laugh into his neck before he kisses the skin there.
"whatever you want, sweetheart," he says, the fondness in his voice at odds with the way his hand grips yoongi’s bare thigh possessively while he twists to his left to pull open a drawer and grab a bottle of lube.
and yoongi can’t hold in the sound that leaves him when taehyung finally wraps his slick hand around his cock.
he squeezes his eyes shut, on the verge of tears as taehyung strokes him closer to his orgasm, and his moans are silenced when taehyung pounces on him for another messy kiss.
"you’ll come for me, won’t you, yoongi?"
taehyung breathes into yoongi’s mouth, voice slipping further and further into his countryside accent as he whispers filthy promises into yoongi’s mouth and jerks him faster and harder.
and as if in response, yoongi digs his nails harder into taehyung’s shoulders and shudders, immediately going limp and spilling into taehyung’s hand.
"just like that, sweetheart.
you’re beautiful."
taehyung rides him through the orgasm until yoongi eventually collapses on the mattress.
taehyung pulls away till they’re panting into each other’s mouths, chests pressed together and faces so close.
looking into taehyung’s eyes, he can see the affection and care he’s grown so familiar to seeing, except it’s now mixed with a reverence that’s new.
"was that okay?"
taehyung breathes into the silence that’s filled by the sound of their hard breathing, and yoongi has to blink rapidly to bring himself back to the reality he’d known outside of this bedroom.
the shift feels disorienting all of a sudden.
yoongi has no idea what to say so he settles for nodding.
taehyung nods as well, and for a moment it’s as if they both are at a loss for words, but taehyung recovers first.
"give me a minute.
i’ll clean us up."
he presses a quick kiss to yoongi’s forehead before climbing off the bed to enter the bathroom attached to the room.
yoongi hears the sound of running water before taehyung returns with a damp cloth and helps clean yoongi up.
yoongi pulls his pants back up and fixes his shirt, but taehyung chooses to collapse on the bed beside yoongi.
and yoongi doesn’t know how to fill the silence.
he has no idea where they stand or what taehyung is thinking.
they’d decided to talk in the morning, so yoongi supposes the logical course of action now would be to return to their own rooms.
but just as he pushes himself to sit upright, taehyung’s voice jolts him out of his thoughts.
"wanna have ice cream?"
yoongi twists around to look at taehyung who’s lying on his side propped up on an elbow, watching him with his cheek on his palm.
"i bought two tubs yesterday," he says, and it takes yoongi a second to realise that this is taehyung’s attempt at bringing back some normalcy to their relationship.
for a long moment, yoongi stares at his husband, his thoughts raging a hurricane in his head, but then his shoulders sag where they’d been pulled tight and, why the fuck not?
"sure," he shrugs and taehyung immediately grins at him, wide and impossibly bright.
he hops back on his feet, shimmying into his pants before he walks out of the room and into the kitchen.
yoongi hears him putter about in the refrigerator for a few moments until there’s the sound of the door being shut and taehyung emerges at the doorway once again.
"chocolate chip for me, and your vanilla."
he makes a face as he hands yoongi his tub, and yoongi rolls his eyes, more than used to taehyung bitching about his preferred ice cream flavor every chance he gets.
it reminds him of their first date when taehyung had quickly dropped all pretense of enjoying the fancy restaurant their parents had arranged their dinner at, suggesting that they go get some convenience store ice cream instead.
the thought makes him grin now.
yoongi hadn’t had a choice back then, but watching taehyung bite down on his elaborate chocolate ice cream cone as they stood leaning against the hood of his car, for the first time, yoongi had felt the dread in his stomach ease just a little.
"i already brushed my teeth though," yoongi mutters as he opens the lid and digs his spoon into the frozen dessert.
he startles when taehyung laughs, and looks up at his husband where he has seated himself in front of yoongi on the bed.
"you did much more with that mouth, love.
eating ice cream should be the last of your concerns right now."
yoongi shoots taehyung an unimpressed look, and taehyung laughs again.
they continue to eat in silence, and it’s surprisingly comfortable.
yoongi is thinking about what will happen to them once it ends when suddenly taehyung speaks again.
"i know you said you wanted to talk about it tomorrow," he starts slowly, like he’s not sure if he should be saying it at all, and yoongi looks up at him with creased eyebrows.
"but i don’t know what’ll happen tomorrow.
and i am not sure if i’ll be able to do this then."
yoongi parts his lips, but he doesn’t get a chance to speak because taehyung suddenly leans forward and traps his chin between a thumb and his knuckle, pulling him closer and pressing their mouths together.
the kiss is soft, and yoongi stares at taehyung in confusion when they part.
"i like you," taehyung whispers.
the words are spoken quietly and with care, and yoongi feels his heart go still.
his mouth tingles where taehyung kissed him, and for a moment the two of them stay like that, staring at one another, till taehyung lets go of him and leans back.
"did i make you uncomfortable?"
he asks softly.
yoongi is frozen stiff where he sits.
he wants to speak but he can’t find the words.
taehyung takes his silence for a response, and yoongi watches him exhale, a loud tired thing, before his husband runs his hand through his hair and breaks gaze, looking down at his lap.
"i’m sorry.
i thought—i thought there was something between us.
but i guess i was wrong.
i’m sorry."
just like before, yoongi feels as if everything is at its precipice, and they’re at the edge of yet another cliff.
everything’s about to go wrong, and yoongi—he can’t have that.
he doesn’t have the words, has no poetic confession, nothing that could do justice to the feelings that have been crammed in his chest for months, threatening to suffocate him, but he’s reaching out anyway.
he shoves the ice cream away, elsewhere on the bed, he couldn’t care less where, and crawls up to taehyung, lifting his chin like he’d done with him.
"i love you," yoongi whispers, and his chest that was so heavy suddenly empties itself in just those three words, leaving him utterly breathless.
taehyung looks the same as yoongi feels, eyes wide with surprise, and yoongi finds himself stuttering again, "i—i’ve loved you for some time now."
"since when?"
taehyung breathes out.
this is harder to word because falling in love with taehyung wasn’t like a flood.
it didn’t happen all at once.
it was like a crack in the tank, one that leaked slowly, unnoticeable to somebody who wasn’t paying attention, and yoongi definitely wasn’t paying attention.
not until he was chest-deep in the crushing water with no way out.
but there is one moment that comes to his mind.
it’s when he knew, when he knew he was sunk.
"when i walked out of that restaurant?"
yoongi starts.
he sits back on the bed, his knees touching taehyung’s, and he sees taehyung’s eyes flicker with recognition.
"we were having dinner with your parents and they kept going on about how we needed to start looking for surrogate mothers?
like adoption wasn’t even a respectable option."
yoongi laughs drily, but taehyung’s hand finds his own and laces their fingers together.
the unsubtle jabs at the lack of yoongi’s lineage come often enough that he’s had to grow accustomed to ignoring them, but both of them know that they’ll never not hurt.
"i stormed out of the restaurant and you chased after me in the rain like a fucking idiot."
yoongi smiles at the memory even though it is an awful one.
"that’s when i knew for sure.
pretty sure it was longer, but that’s when it really sunk in."
"but you hated me then."
"i—" "no, you told me you hated me that night."
yoongi exhales and rubs a palm over his face, the one that’s not interlaced with taehyung’s.
he did say that, amongst other much worse things.
"i was being hurtful on purpose," he admits and meets taehyung’s eyes.
"i didn’t hate you.
i never hated you, just hated the circumstances i met you under.
i’m sorry, i didn’t even apologise properly for what i said to you."
"you don’t need to."
"no, i do," yoongi says with more force.
"you didn’t deserve it.
you were just the easiest person to target at the time."
taehyung looks at their hands, and for a moment he’s silent.
when he speaks again, he squeezes yoongi’s hand.
"you didn’t deserve this either," he says, voice both thick and quiet.
and something in yoongi’s chest suddenly hardens.
it’s the way taehyung sounds defeated, the way taehyung, who’s been nothing but so stupidly good to him, thinks that he should be the one apologising.
it makes yoongi pull his hand out of taehyung’s hold and grab him by the cheeks, forcing taehyung to look at him.
"i didn’t want this, but we both know that," he says matter-of-factly because it is the truth.
"it wasn’t an ideal marriage, and i wish our start wasn’t so manufactured, that it wasn’t what it was, but i don’t regret it."
taehyung’s face is still hard, not entirely convinced, and yoongi sighs.
he leans forward till their foreheads touch.
"by the end of the day, i’m married to you and that’s all that matters," he whispers.
"it may not be an ideal marriage, but with you, it’s hard to mind."
taehyung’s eyes soften, and yoongi watches his lips stretch into a slow sweet smile.
"sweetheart, you’re making it very hard for me not to kiss you right now," he whispers.
yoongi has to laugh.
he meets taehyung’s gaze, and he knows that this is a moment he’ll remember for the rest of his life, the way taehyung looks at him like there’s nothing else worth watching.
"what’s stopping you?"
he whispers against taehyung’s lips, and taehyung doesn’t need to be told twice.
he grins and slants his head to slot their lips together, and yoongi finds himself smiling into the kiss.
they kiss for long, deep and sensual, and if he wasn’t so desperate, yoongi would be embarrassed by how quickly his body responds to taehyung’s fingers slipping under his shirt to encircle his waist.
he doesn’t think before he crawls into taehyung’s lap to straddle him.
but judging by how quickly taehyung’s arms wrap themselves fully around his midriff, tugging him even closer till they’re pressed against each other, he doesn’t seem to mind.
arousal streaks down yoongi’s spine, and he slides his arms around taehyung’s neck before rolling his hips down against his crotch.
taehyung moans into the kiss.
"you want it?"
he asks breathlessly before pushing yoongi down till he’s pressing him into the mattress and looming over him.
"again?"
yoongi feels the hard outline of taehyung’s cock pressing against his own when taehyung spreads yoongi’s legs a little wider and thrusts down harder against his stuttering hips.
"want you," he gasps out in between kisses, shivering underneath taehyung’s broader body.
"always want you."
"yeah?"
taehyung says over the wet smacks of their kisses, the breathy gasps, and yoongi whines when he pulls away only to latch onto his neck, dropping kisses along his throat and biting down hard where yoongi’s neck slopes into his shoulder.
when taehyung finally pulls away after marking what yoongi is sure is a dark flaming bruise on his skin, yoongi lets himself look at him, at his mouth that’s swollen and cherry-red.
because of him.
the knowledge has yoongi’s body tingling for an entirely different reason.
and when taehyung tugs up the hem of his shirt, yoongi lifts his arms and lets him pull it off him in one harsh motion and toss it on the floor.
taehyung does the same with his pants, throwing them to the side without looking away from where yoongi lies underneath him, and it’s a different kind of intimacy, being completely naked under taehyung’s dark eyes.
taehyung doesn’t let him curl away.
he runs his palms down yoongi’s bare thighs till he reaches his knees and lifts one of them to press a kiss against it.
"you’re gorgeous," he whispers, and yoongi watches him through his lashes as he slides his palms down to hold yoongi’s feet by his ankles.
"what are you doing?"
he asks him when taehyung starts to bend yoongi’s knees and push them up until they’re flattened against his chest and he has one of yoongi’s ankles pressed against his mouth.
"you have pretty feet."
taehyung places an open mouthed kiss over the jut of yoongi’s pale ankle, and yoongi gasps.
his foot jerks in taehyung’s hold but taehyung grips him tighter.
"pretty ankles."
"ankles?"
yoongi echoes incredulously, but his voice shakes, and he sounds breathless and wrecked.
"that’s what gets you off?"
taehyung laughs, and yoongi’s entire body tingles.
his husband looks absolutely devilish when he smiles at him, his sweat-damp hair hanging low over his eyes.
"my vanilla sweetheart," taehyung teases him, and presses one sweet kiss into the arch of yoongi’s foot, "we’re going to have so much fun, i promise you."
yoongi likes to believe that his patience stretches a lot further than most, but when his waltz partner, a self-absorbed pompous bastard who has had not one word to speak about anyone but himself in the fifteen minutes yoongi has danced with him, begins to enter into another long tale about the one time he almost defeated achilles and threw him into the pits of tartarus, yoongi doesn't spare a moment to hesitation before he accidentally stumbles forward and slams down the heel of his sandal hard on the bastard's toes.
the man cries out in pain, and yoongi is instantly the picture of innocence and apology.
he offers to walk him back to a seat, but the man is much too prideful to accept and retreats from the dance floor instead, limping and cursing the entire while.
yoongi doesn't spare him a glance and turns around to march towards the wine, grabbing a goblet of it and draining it in one go, uncaring of how juvenile it looks.
he doesn't have time to waste.
there's a little over two hours left before the clock strikes twelve and the courting ball comes to a close, and yoongi twists around with a renewed determination to approach someone else who catches his eye.
but just as he turns, yoongi ends up colliding against a hard chest.
and he would've stumbled back and tripped on the hem of his own dress had two large palms not come to steady him by the waist.
"careful," comes a deep voice, and yoongi jerks his head up in surprise and finds an unfamiliar face concealed under a black mask.
caught off guard by the sudden close proximity, yoongi stares at him in a stiff stupor.
underneath his mask, the man's eyes are coal black, darker than yoongi's ever seen.
he is taller than yoongi, and although that is hardly a feat, he is tall enough that yoongi has to crane his neck a little to look at him in the eye—a task that seems almost impossible to carry out with the way yoongi’s cheeks are warming at the weight of the man’s hands on his waist, fingers long enough that they encircle his waist almost entirely.
the man is dressed in black from head to toe save for the glittering silver dangling from his ears, and yoongi has been studying everyone's masks for even a hint of their identity, but there's nothing he can discern from the man's mask, weaved as it is with small black feathers and lined silver at its edges.
they stare at each other for a long moment before yoongi speaks.
"did you wish for a dance?"
he asks.
he's consumed enough alcohol to wash out all traces of shyness in him.
shyness would get him nowhere tonight.
the man lifts an elegant eyebrow before his face settles into an amused smile and his palms on yoongi's waist fall.
yoongi stupidly misses the warmth of them.
"that was the plan, but i also wish to remain uninjured for the rest of the night," he says, the corner of his lips quirked up in a way that tells yoongi that he's teasing.
yoongi blinks a few more times before the heat crawls up to his cheeks and colors it blush red.
"that—it was an accident!"
he splutters.
the man looks even more amused and doesn't seem to believe him in the slightest.
"i dare say the poor fellow wouldn't be able to walk straight for a week," he teases.
yoongi parts his lips to argue, but no words come to him in his flustered state, and the man laughs as he takes a step closer.
yoongi has to fight the urge to take one back.
"is this your goal?
you charm men into dancing with you and then leave them disabled for life?"
there’s mirth dancing in his eyes, and yoongi scoffs, trying to regain some semblance of control even as his cheeks burn scarlet.
"not all men.
only the ones who bore me to death."
"is that so?"
the man murmurs before taking another step closer, a devilish tug to his lips as he smiles at yoongi charmingly.
"perhaps i should take my chances then?"
yoongi bites his lip to contain the smile that threatens to spill out of him.
"even if it might cost you a limb?"
he asks, tipping up his chin flirtatiously.
the man leans in further till their faces are much too close, and yoongi’s treacherous heart thrashes wildly against his ribs, too loud not to be heard.
yoongi feels his breath against his lips when the man speaks again.
"i dare say it is worth the wager."
ever since yoongi came of age, his mother had been possessed with the thought of finding him a partner.
for months, she arranged evenings with countless gods and nymphs and heroes, all meticulously picked from the pool of potential suitors that fit her mold of an ideal husband.
and even though yoongi was aware that her dedication and persistence came from a good place, it left him seething.
he rejected every person she picked for him, and it was not that they were flawed or that yoongi was fussy.
it was quite the opposite.
yoongi hated the orchestrated nature of the arrangement, and he is aware that many would call him naive, an idealist, would tell him that things in real life rarely fell together like a fairytale.
yoongi knows, gods he knows, but he just wants a choice.
he wants to be the one to pick the person he has to spend the rest of his eternity with, and he admits that he is being an idealist, for no one on olympus has a drop of fidelity in their blood.
still, yoongi thinks, he should get to choose who he is to be wed to, and this was the very reason he and his mother fought last month, one of the countless arguments they'd had on the very topic before his mother finally gave in.
a courting ball, she'd said, on mount olympus.
he could choose his betrothed from amongst the attendees.
when the clock struck twelve, the man he'd be dancing with would be picked to be his husband.
and if he picked no one, he'd have to go along with the dates his mother arranged for him without a fuss.
yoongi had agreed, like a fool.
because one foot inside the hall and he'd realized what a grave mistake that had been.
it was a masquerade ball.
and that, in addition to the fact that yoongi had never attended the opulent events on mount olympus before this one, he had not one idea of anyone's identity.
his mother had obviously known that and she was probably expecting him to give up, but the knowledge had only served to steel his nerves.
brimming with an indignant resolve, yoongi had marched straight to the wine and drank just enough to dissolve his usual reservations before proceeding to pick whoever caught his fancy, intent on finding himself a man to marry before the night came to a close.
the man holds yoongi's hand in his own as he bends at the waist and brings it to his lips.
"so?"
he asks again, looking up at him through his eyelashes.
"may i have this dance?"
yoongi fights the furious flush flaming his cheeks, eyes darting away from the man's intense gaze as he nods silently.
from the corner of his eye, he catches the man's lips breaking into a small sweet grin.
it is a genuine, happy thing unlike the devilish smirks from before, and it steals yoongi's breath away.
but he has not the chance to utter a word before he's being pulled in the direction of the dance floor.
the crowd seems to part for them, not so much in awe but like the wilt of a flower, and the man leads them further away till they're standing in a more secluded corner.
yoongi fights the urge to shy away from the man's gaze and forces himself to meet his eyes.
the man smiles in assurance as he places a palm on yoongi's waist and lifts the one joined with yoongi's, changing the hold so their fingers are entangled in a firm lock.
yoongi places his own hand on the man's shoulder, and thankfully his body takes over once they begin to sway, muscle memory guiding him through the steps because his mind cannot fathom a single thought beyond the broad palm on his waist and the burn of the man's eyes on his own.
"i don't think i've seen you on olympus before," the man murmurs lowly as they fall into the rhythm of the music.
"i'm certain i'd have noticed you if you had."
yoongi raises a skeptical eyebrow.
"you don't even know what i look like," he points out.
his own mask had been brought to him after he'd entered, a pale white lace mask to match his tulle dress.
"i don't need to, sweetheart," the man leans in to murmur into his ear, and a shiver streaks down yoongi's spine.
"this mask does a dreadful job of concealing your beauty.
not that it ever could."
yoongi feels his cheeks burn at the words.
he's never been one to grow flustered so easily, but there's something about this man that is so wholly disorienting, it has his heart slamming against his ribs, threatening to tip him forward right into the broad chest in front of him.
"you're very straightforward," he settles on saying finally.
"perhaps," the man concedes.
"but what good does it do to keep up pretenses just to save face?"
yoongi doesn't reply, and the man shrugs.
"i think you're beautiful," he states bluntly, "and i wish to tell you so.
it does not embarrass me."
yoongi bites his lip and ducks his head.
he doesn't know the right response to such a statement, but yoongi can’t deny that he finds the man's candour immensely attractive.
"you were right," he says after a few moments of silence pass between them, and he feels the man's gaze slide back onto him.
"this is my first time on olympus."
"and how are you finding it?
considering that i caught you stepping on people's feet, i assume not very good?"
yoongi laughs.
he sees the man smile as well.
and in an uncharacteristically bold move, yoongi pulls his hand out of the man's hold.
sliding both palms up his shoulders till he has his arms wrapped around the man's neck, yoongi slants his head back to meet the man's gaze.
"not at first," he smiles coyly, "but now—it's not too bad."
they're much too close now, and yoongi catches the way the man's eyes widen briefly before his face settles back into a sweet, amused grin and both of his palms curl around the curve of yoongi's waist, pulling him even closer so they're almost chest to chest.
they're barely even dancing now, just swaying together in their spot.
"how would you score your present company then?"
the man asks him.
"tell me my numbers.
will i be losing any of my legs tonight?
my arms perhaps?"
yoongi bites down on his lip to keep himself from grinning like he knows he wants to.
"what do you want to know?"
he indulges him.
the man cocks his head to the side as he thinks for a moment.
"personality?"
he ventures.
"not appearance first?"
yoongi teases.
the man laughs.
and yoongi can't help thinking that he's really found the one.
he can't think of anyone else he'd rather be dancing with tonight.
"no, i'm confident about that."
yoongi scoffs.
the man is grinning widely, and there's really something so undeniably attractive about his shameless confidence.
"personality, out of ten…eight and a half?"
yoongi says, lying straight through his teeth because anything less than a ten is a falsehood.
"eight and a half?"
"you could do with some humility.
but i'll be forgiving."
"forgiving?"
the man echoes.
he sounds amused, and yoongi doesn't expect it at all when he is suddenly yanked forward for the man to whisper hotly into his ear.
"darling, a seven would be forgiving.
an eight and a half just means you're completely and hopelessly charmed."
flustered, yoongi is about to retaliate, but he is suddenly lifted into the air and twirled as the man smoothly exits the easy dance they'd adopted, entering into the more fanciful steps of the waltz with little difficulty.
yoongi squeaks in surprise and stumbles when his feet touch the ground once again.
the man laughs, and yoongi would glower at him if he wasn't so sure that he'd only enjoy that more.
he doesn't realise when the song comes to a close, just feels the man's hands slacken around his waist, not falling away completely but just touching.
"another one?"
he asks, putting enough space between them that yoongi could pull away easily if he wished to.
not that yoongi wants to.
"another one," yoongi smiles and confirms, closing the gap between them again.
the man grins before his palms come to hold him firmly, and they start to sway once again.
one dance turns to two, which then blurs into several more till yoongi loses count of them.
they dance, and when they aren't dancing, they'd be swaying lightly and talking, and when they wouldn't be talking, yoongi would feel the man's eyes on him, so warm and intense that yoongi can never match it for too long.
people begin to stare at them eventually, and it is only then that yoongi realizes that it is a courting ball and the two of them have danced to a dozen songs already and yoongi's feet are starting to ache now.
that isn't the only reason.
yoongi is sure his mother has been keeping an eye on him, and suddenly he doesn't want to be here at all.
which is why he pulls the man to a stop and lifts himself on his toes to speak into his ear.
"would you like to get out of here?"
they don't reach very far, just till the music grows soft enough to ignore, and then yoongi is being pressed back against the trunk of a tree.
yoongi grins when the man crowds him against it.
they're in the gardens at the back of the palace, and it is lit up by little yellow lights that fall across the man's face and make his jawline appear even sharper.
yoongi curls his fingers into the fabric of the man's coat, yanking him close enough so they're breathing in the same air.
"you're eager," the man whispers against his lips.
"do you have something else you'd rather be attending to?"
yoongi asks drily, raising both his eyebrows.
"none other than you, sweetheart."
the man smiles, and he doesn't waste time before pressing their lips together sweetly.
it certainly isn't yoongi's first kiss, and he doesn't know if the man believes it is, because the kiss is soft, tenderly so.
he brings a palm to cup yoongi's cheek and tilts his face to the side as he presses their lips together again and again, soft like the touch of peonies against skin.
and yoongi feels himself melting into it.
"can i?"
the man's voice is so soft that yoongi would've missed it entirely if he hadn't felt his lips move against his own.
he doesn't realise what he means until he feels fingers gently tugging at the lace that ties his mask together at the back of his head.
not hard enough to undo it, but just enough to bring yoongi's attention to it.
and yoongi can’t deny the twinge of fear he feels at the thought of losing the familiar anonymity, but the mask no longer holds any meaning so he bites his lip and nods.
he feels the lace being undone, and the mask falls off his face before dropping on the grass between their feet.
perhaps it really had been too naive of him to hope that it'd be easy as that.
because not a second later where yoongi had all of the man's front pressed against his own, he now stands completely alone.
it isn't in yoongi's nature to let the measure of his worth be defined by the shape and structure of his face, but it is hard to hide the hurt he feels when he sees the man take a step back when he finally catches sight of yoongi's face.
"yoongi," the man says now, and yoongi has to hold down the shiver that threatens to shake his body at the sound of his name falling from the man's lips.
he watches the man's eyes take all of him in before flitting back to his face.
and yoongi suddenly feels so cold.
he wraps his arms around his chest, feeling too exposed too early; and the vulnerability must've shown because the man's eyes widen, and he immediately steps back in to close the gap between them, cupping his face once again.
"oh, sweetheart, no, you're beautiful.
more so than i could've ever imagined."
yoongi can't stop the tears that gather in his eyes.
but it is impossible to hide them so he doesn't bother.
"then why do you look like you’d rather be anywhere but here?"
he asks, and he can't keep down the tremble in his voice.
"i—" the man starts but stops like he isn't certain what the right words are.
"it was not my intention to lead you on."
yoongi squeezes his eyes shut.
he feels so foolish.
he can't stop the shiver this time, and he feels the man's arms wrap around his waist.
yoongi wants him to stop.
"i was not aware of your identity, and i know that is a poor excuse, but darling, i cannot marry you."
yoongi would've fled if he could, if he wasn't caged against a tree with the man's arms around him.
he's being forced to suffer the humiliation anyway so he dares to ask, even if part of him doesn't wish to know at all.
"why?"
he croaks out.
"yoongi—" "tell me the truth," yoongi opens his eyes.
"do i not deserve to know?
tell me why, why do you believe a marriage between us is impossible?"
the man looks conflicted, like he's both desperate and reluctant to tell.
in the end, he doesn't speak.
he pulls away from yoongi and reaches behind himself to untie his own mask.
yoongi holds his breath, but when the mask falls and the man lifts his head to meet his eyes, yoongi loses all air in his chest.
he had presumed he was dancing with a hero, or perhaps a minor god at most, and yoongi may not be the best at recognising faces of the olympians.
but even he knows the face of the ruler of the underworld, arguably the most hated man on mount olympus.
"taehyung," yoongi whispers now, and the smile taehyung returns is almost pained.
they haven't met before, but yoongi has heard enough to get a general idea.
"there's still some time remaining," taehyung murmurs with a glance towards the palace where the soft hum of the music can still be heard.
"you should—you should look for somebody more suitable."
taehyung must take yoongi's silence for agreement because he takes a step back to further the distance between them; and he looks like he's going to vanish any moment, but yoongi's hand shoots out and his fingers close around taehyung's wrist, stopping him before he can leave.
"yoongi, love, please do not make this more difficult," taehyung sighs.
he isn’t meeting yoongi’s eyes, and it makes something awful grow in yoongi’s chest.
"your mother would not wish for you to be wed to me."
it is not a lie.
yoongi's mother has not made a secret of her distaste for taehyung.
yoongi does not know the reason for it, but he seldom did when it came to olympian politics; and yoongi feels a sudden rage shoot down his arms at the thought of being controlled by matters that had nothing to do with him.
tightening his grip around taehyung’s wrist, he asks instead.
"do you?"
"what?"
surprisingly, yoongi doesn’t feel hesitant.
"do you wish to marry me?"
taehyung’s wide eyes fly up to meet his, and yoongi tugs him closer until their chests are pressed together once again.
"yoongi—" "it is not my mother whom you'll be wed to."
he lifts his chin defiance, feeling uncharacteristically belligerent.
he’s tolerated being ruled by his mother’s will long enough, and he will not let her ruin this for him.
"it is me.
do you wish to marry me?"
for a long moment taehyung doesn’t speak, and yoongi clenches his teeth tight, willing the tears to not fall.
"because i do," his voice wavers despite his attempts.
"i wish for you to be wed to me."
the sharp lines in taehyung’s face soften, and he brings a palm to cup yoongi’s cheek, wiping away a tear before it can spill down.
"sweetheart, you must know i want nothing more than to make you mine."
"then do it," yoongi whispers.
"make me yours."
taehyung smiles at that, and yoongi can’t even bring himself to feel embarrassed at his boldness.
"you know just as well as i do that it is not possible," taehyung murmurs, and now that yoongi knows to look for it, the sadness in his eyes is evident.
"not one man on this realm will side with me if your mother objects to our betrothal.
which she will."
yoongi wants to scream at the unfairness of it all.
for all that he’s heard of taehyung in the hushed warning whispers of the dryads, not one word has come close to what he’s seen of him: compassionate and unabashedly charming taehyung with his soft grins and sweet touches, tender even in his teasing.
he can’t lose him, yoongi realises.
he won’t.
and once the resolve settles into his spine, straightening his shoulders and tipping yoongi’s head up so he can stare right into taehyung’s eyes, the answer comes to him easily.
"then we shall make it impossible for her or anybody else to object to it," he says.
there is a brief moment where taehyung’s eyes are clouded with confusion, but when the meaning underlying yoongi’s words sinks in, they grow impossibly wider.
"i—" he swallows and pauses, but yoongi can tell that he’s considering it.
"i cannot ask that of you," taehyung whispers.
"you are not.
i am the one suggesting it."
and yoongi is surprised by how right it feels.
where he expected to find hesitation, he only feels a surge of adrenaline and excitement brimming inside of him at the thought.
taehyung licks his lips, and something in his eyes is darkening.
his hand falls to yoongi’s waist and grips it tight enough that it feels almost possessive.
"you’ll never see her again," he says.
"you won’t ever be able to set foot in this place again."
yoongi can’t help the incredulous laugh that leaves him.
"i think we already established that i am not interested in setting a foot in this place ever again."
but taehyung doesn’t look convinced.
his eyebrows are creased in the middle even though his grip around yoongi’s waist is tight as a vice.
"are you certain?
it is not—it’s not a decision you should make for someone you’ve only known for a night."
instead of replying, yoongi lifts himself up on his toes and presses their lips together once again.
and despite his hesitation, taehyung kisses him back, and this kiss is a lot less chaste.
the sounds of the wet slide of their mouths parting and meeting again and again are loud in the night, and yoongi rests his forehead against taehyung’s when they finally part for air.
"what else must i do to convince you that i am not a child?"
he breathes out against taehyung’s lips.
"i was prepared to be wed to a stranger, and i am aware that we’ve only known each other for a meager few hours.
i am not naive.
i held no fanciful ideas of finding love tonight."
taehyung starts to speak, but yoongi cuts him off.
"i was looking for someone i could see myself growing to love with time," he says.
"and i may not know you well enough, but even in this little time, you showed me that you’re thoughtful.
you’ve shown me kindness.
you’ve cared for my well-being despite having no reason to."
yoongi leans forward and presses a soft kiss to taehyung's lips.
"what is holding you back?"
he asks and releases taehyung's wrist in favour of tangling their fingers together.
taehyung sighs, leaning into him a little.
his voice is softer when he speaks again.
"i am afraid that you are making a decision you cannot undo, and that with time, you may grow to hate it and hate me along with it."
yoongi smiles and feels his heart expand with an inexplicable fondness, taehyung’s hesitance only serving to strengthen his own resolve.
"but is that not a given?"
he asks him, cocking his head to the side as he lets his thumb stroke soothing circles against taehyung’s hand.
"i could say the same for you.
you could grow to hate me as well.
we can never know the consequences of our decision prior to making it.
but that is seldom a reason not to try."
there is a brief pause where yoongi supposes taehyung is considering his own decision.
"life in the underworld will be different," taehyung says ultimately.
"i cannot give you everything you may be used to here."
yoongi is about to argue, but taehyung’s head drops into the curve between his neck and shoulder, and his voice is a whisper against yoongi’s ear.
"but i promise that i’ll take care of you, and even though what we have isn’t love yet, you will always have my utmost devotion and respect and loyalty.
that won’t change regardless of what may happen in the future."
yoongi feels his heart kick inside his chest, and he couldn’t fight the grin that pulls at his lips even if he tried.
"that is already more than what i expected from my marriage," he whispers and presses his lips to taehyung’s cheek.
"thank you.
we may not be lovers yet, but i wish very much to be."
taehyung smiles and twists his face, and they’re kissing again, just a firm press of their lips filled with unspoken promises.
"we should get going," taehyung whispers when he pulls away.
"not much time remains."
yoongi squeezes their hands in lieu of a verbal affirmation and lets taehyung pull him away from the shade of the tree.
beneath the yellow lights, yoongi meets taehyung’s searching gaze one final time, and taehyung must find whatever it is he’s looking for because soon enough, not far from where they stand, the ground suddenly shakes and cleaves open, groaning heavily as it splits apart and widens till yoongi sees a dark, long staircase spiralling far, far down into the earth.
the two of them stand in silence, watching each other, and yoongi supposes taehyung is waiting for him.
before he can think too much, yoongi takes the first step, tugging taehyung behind him as they slowly make their way down the stairwell, the earth swallowing them up once the entrance fuses back together like it had never been split in the first place.
from thereon, taehyung’s hand is the only source of guidance in the dark.
yoongi lets him lead them down further into the mouth of the earth till they arrive before two looming silver gates lit by a dim gray light.
taehyung turns around to face him, and if yoongi had any doubts about his identity before, they’re certainly squashed now.
stood with his back to the looming gates, taehyung looks every bit like the ruler of the underworld.
his face is pale in the half-light, shadows flickering behind his eyes and his jawline sharp like it’s been cut by a chisel.
but his hand is still warm against yoongi’s when he pulls him closer.
"this is the last chance.
we can still turn back," taehyung whispers even though his tight grip on yoongi’s hand tells yoongi he wants anything but that.
yoongi pulls his hand out of taehyung’s hold and winds both his arms around taehyung’s neck, pulling him down to press their lips together in a sweet kiss.
"you may turn back," yoongi whispers into taehyung’s mouth, "but i won’t be coming with you."
taehyung smiles into the kiss, and yoongi closes his eyes as he lets himself soak in the earth humming beneath his feet.
it doesn’t take him long to feel into the roots and, with a sweet word, coax a shy shrub of pomegranates to blossom from the soil.
he breaks the kiss to pick the fruit and place a few of its seeds on his tongue before diving back in to capture taehyung’s mouth again.
the juice of the fruit spills and stains their kiss, binding yoongi to taehyung’s realm and rule for all eternity.
somewhere far above them, the clock strikes twelve, but yoongi cannot fathom a single thought beyond the touch of taehyung’s soft, coaxing mouth on his own.
and when taehyung pulls away and presses their foreheads together, yoongi sees the way his eyes shine with a reverent sweetness.
it makes him smile and spring up to peck taehyung’s nose.
they may not be lovers, but yoongi doubts it’ll take them long to get there.
yoongi’s never been a heavy sleeper.
when the long drapes of silk hanging from the ceiling around his bed gently part, the bells tied to their hem tinkling with the soft sweeping movement, his eyes fly open and blink rapidly in the dark.
he is blind for several long moments of silence, and it seems like his visitor is content with simply watching him take short, panicked breaths where he lies shrouded in the stranger's shadow, one arm twisted under the pillow where he keeps his knife and the other fisted in the thick cotton sheets.
"yoongi," a voice says quietly, its timbre and pitch so achingly familiar, yoongi’s eyes fly to the dark figure looming over him.
his mouth parts with a gasp but no sound leaves his constricted throat.
he can’t move even if he tries, muscles rigid with shock and his chest heaving with loud noisy inhales that betray the panic collecting in it.
his visitor doesn’t appear to care for his apprehension since he’s casually climbing onto the bed, and yoongi’s foot jerks out with violent instinct when cold fingers close around his ankle.
"shh," the man soothes.
his thumb slowly strokes the thin skin above the jut of yoongi’s ankle, and yoongi can't move.
he wheezes—he can’t breathe, can’t suck in air when his stomach is clenched so tight.
he can see him better now: a dim stray strand of moonlight filters through the silk curtains and cascades across the man’s face, illuminating the hard edges of his tall, sloping nose, the sharp cheekbone, his ear and his jaw.
dark lashes embellishing even darker eyes, a gold glittering earring, long and thin, swinging from one lobe, and lips parted slightly to bare a sharp row of white teeth.
it’s him.
except he’s— a hard lump collects in yoongi’s throat, the muscle there so dry, yoongi swallows painfully.
the quiet grows heavier.
taehyung sits on his knees at the foot of yoongi’s bed, still as the dead save for the smooth circling movements of his thumb across yoongi’s bare ankle.
at the first glance, he looks no different from when yoongi saw him last—eight years ago, when horses had stormed into their town and men in uniforms had unrolled the official decree, tipped their chins high, and announced the nationwide compulsory military conscription—when taehyung had cupped yoongi’s face in his palms and wiped the tear that had rolled down yoongi’s cheek.
i’ll be back, he’d whispered against yoongi’s lips and pressed their foreheads together.
this isn’t a goodbye.
but the longer yoongi gazes at his husband’s body, the more aware he grows of the differences between then and—impossibly—now.
half of his face is shadowed, moonlit fluorescence pouring on one side and his tall, straight nose serving as a line of demarcation.
when yoongi looks up, he meets taehyung’s eyes, and there’s a dreadful moment where the two of them lie stiff and still and stare at each other in the dark.
taehyung looks older.
it shows in the strong lines of his jaw, in the thick tendons on his neck, in his dark ovular eyes and his broad shoulders.
or maybe it’s yoongi’s mind that’s picked at the memories incessantly and twisted their frayed strands together to weave an unrecognizable picture.
the soft curve of the cupid’s bow that yoongi kissed when they lay together in the gazebo, painted in the orange sheen of the melting evening sun, is now deeper than he remembers, the moles on his waterline, his nose, his lip all darker, his eyebrows longer and thicker.
but the most obvious change is the long, thick black hair that sits in gentle waves around his face.
taehyung always kept his hair short; it was a nuisance during the warmer months when he needed to work in the fields for hours under the sun's glare.
except thick locks of hair hang before his eyes now, curls peeking out from behind his neck, and in a surreal moment of vulnerability, yoongi reaches out with a trembling hand as if to run his fingers through it like he’d done so many times before.
but he aborts the movement just as it quickly comes and crushes it in the sheets once again.
taehyung remains unmoving throughout yoongi’s turmoil, carefully watching yoongi with those deep unblinking eyes.
yoongi feels his dark stare crawl all over his body, taking in the gray blouse, the sleeves that reach his elbows, neckline that sits over his clavicles, the exposed midriff, petticoat tied above his belly-button and tangled between his legs, its hem resting just inches from where taehyung’s slender fingers have trapped his ankle.
the stillness stretches between them, and yoongi gasps when taehyung slowly leans forward and slides his fingers further up his leg, dragging the hem of his skirt up his calves.
the night air is cold.
rains are receding, and a new winter sits just at the horizon on its haunches.
goosebumps follow taehyung’s fingers, streaking across yoongi’s exposed skin, who shudders, fists his fingers in the sheets and parts his dry lips in a quiet shaky exhale.
"taehyung-ah," he whispers, voice quivering before it cracks wetly on the final syllable and settles thickly between them.
it sounds quiet even when everything around them stands still.
the rain’s stopped, and the entire house is silent, too quiet, too empty.
yoongi is convinced that this is a dream.
or a nightmare.
taehyung laughs to himself quietly.
his thumb slows, following the sparse scatter of hair on yoongi’s calf as if taking his time to memorise it, and yoongi feels like his ribs will fracture under the weight of his chest, so heavy that yoongi can only draw in shallow, wet inhales.
"yoongi," taehyung says again, lips curling at the corners and thumb now rubbing at his knee in small circles.
sharp points of ingrown hair bend under his touch, and when taehyung looks at him, yoongi can’t understand the expression on his face.
tall nose, defined philtrum, lashes long, and something dark and dreadful lurking behind those eyes.
taehyung brings his other hand to hold yoongi by both of his legs, grip loosening so he can rub down to yoongi’s ankles and slide his fingers back up under his skirt, just as slow.
each night yoongi dreamt of taehyung, he imagined that man who’d kiss him sweet and deep in the rain.
lips stained with strawberries and smiles too big for his face.
all eight of their cows named after classic bengali writers, and his big, calloused hands warm as they cupped yoongi’s jaw.
the man in front of him isn’t that taehyung.
it strikes him like thunder each time he blinks and sees him: jaw squared out, posture confident, none of that sweet innocence yoongi had grown familiar with.
"is it—" he croaks out, throat tightening around the impossible words, "it’s really you?"
light pours in through the curtains and traces the sharp and gentle slopes of taehyung’s face.
familiar and foreign, yoongi thinks, an eight-year landscape sprawling across his face that yoongi is a stranger to.
he wants to touch it, he thinks, like a starving man, and tightens his fists in the sheets till nails cut into his palms past the fabric.
taehyung watches him for a second that stretches into several.
silently, he rubs his thumb over the jut of yoongi’s pale knee under his skirt.
yoongi shudders then exhales.
"it’s me."
taehyung says, like a secret, and bends down to press a kiss into the crease of his folded knee.
when he raises his head, yoongi watches the dark eyes bore into his own.
"i’m back, sweetheart," his husband whispers quietly with reverence.
and yoongi can’t contain the strangled sound that tears from his throat.
his chest heaves, and yoongi slaps a hand over his face.
over his mouth.
sinking his teeth into the flesh there to stop himself from trembling and shaking as a storm wrecks his body.
taehyung runs slow palms up yoongi’s legs, over his knees and his thighs, pushing the fabric of his skirt all the way up, and yoongi squeezes his eyes shut.
another kiss inside his knee, slower.
taehyung spreads his legs apart so he can scoot closer between them.
"you don’t believe me?"
he says as he noses into the underside of his thigh and presses a kiss at the soft inner fat.
yoongi suppresses a shiver.
"i just—" yoongi starts, then stops to hold in a sob.
"i can’t—" he exhales wetly, throat constricting.
yoongi blinks back the tears and lifts his eyes to stare at the long drapes of silk that shroud them.
he can feel taehyung’s stare on him but can’t meet it.
taehyung doesn’t try to pry the words out of him.
instead, strong fingers come to curl around the sharp bone of yoongi’s hip, and taehyung pulls himself over his body till he has his mouth pressed against the fleshy middle of yoongi’s belly.
"it’s me," he shapes the words into yoongi’s skin, the hand still on yoongi’s thigh tightening its grip possessively.
when he looks back up at yoongi, yoongi feels like he’s going delirious, surrounded by taehyung’s scent, his hot exhales fanning against yoongi’s skin and his weight pinning yoongi’s lower body to the bed.
"i missed you, my love," his husband says sweetly— —and yoongi breaks.
he swallows around nothing, chokes on a dry sob as a steady stream of wetness trails down his cheek and enters his ear.
"i—" he tries and licks at the cracks on his chapped lips.
"shh," taehyung shushes him, pressing a series of soothing kisses against his quivering stomach as yoongi heaves out unsteady exhales.
a kiss on the divots of his hips, then the rise of his hip bones.
his fingers slide up and find the curve of yoongi’s waist, holding it while he untucks his legs so he can lie prone in the space between yoongi’s spread thighs.
he keeps his upper body propped up on his forearm and lifts yoongi’s leg by the thigh he’s holding, hooking it up his shoulder before diving in between yoongi’s open legs.
yoongi gasps.
taehyung’s hot exhales make him break out in full-body shiver.
petticoat a crushed pile of fabric bundled around his hips, yoongi’s head tips back against the pillows, mattress rolling in quiet protest when his spine arches up against the bed.
"you smell so good," taehyung rasps and immediately presses an open-mouthed kiss against his clit, languid and syrup-slow.
since his father’s death ten years ago, it has fallen upon taehyung, as the duke of the pluto province, to attend the trials that take place once every year, on the autumn equinoxe, in the court of the gods.
but despite having done it for a decade, the foreboding sensation doesn’t fail to climb up the column of his throat and constrict it, strangling all air out of him.
it is jungkook’s steady arm around his waist that keeps taehyung’s treacherous knees from buckling under him and depositing him on the cold marble floor.
taehyung places his own fingers atop jungkook’s hand that is gripping his hip tightly, and gives it a reassuring squeeze.
it doesn’t seem to convince his knight, but taehyung interlaces their fingers instead and forcefully removes jungkook’s hand from his hip.
he takes in a steadying breath, briefly squeezing his eyes shut before pushing them open with force and twisting around to meet jungkook’s gaze with a confidence he does not feel.
jungkook will see through him, but that is not significant.
they are about to enter the courtroom, and taehyung cannot let even a sliver of vulnerability show unless he wishes to invite the vultures to feast on him.
"it is as if you have no faith in me, kook-ah," taehyung says, forcing his lips into a playful grin as he teasingly pinches jungkook’s cheek and causes the younger boy to scowl.
"you wound me."
"it is not you whom i don’t trust."
jungkook darts a meaningful glance at the two large doors before them, eyeing them with a loathing that does not suit him.
fondness brims and spills over inside taehyung’s chest, his smile growing genuine when he chastises jungkook with a smack of a palm against the back of his neck.
"you make it sound like i am the one on trial," taehyung admonishes him, then strides forward in the dreadful direction.
"it makes no sense to delay the inevitable.
let us go and hope that it does not last a moonturn."
beyond the doors is a wide descending staircase that leads into a massive circular amphitheatre.
rows of raised seats, curving up into the sky like a basin, are congested with rowdy commoners, but taehyung hears all noise die into a cold silence when the sight of his arrival is caught.
he doesn’t let his steps falter, lifting his chin even higher once he emerges out of the arched stairwell and into the open courtroom.
there’s a silk shirt laced all the way up to his throat, and a thick black robe tied over his torso to provide him with some semblance of a protection, but taehyung still feels the hot brand of their gazes leave a crawl of blisters across his skin.
he stops for a moment to let his eyes wander across the enormous room.
there are nine thrones arranged around the room in a circular fashion, four on either side of the führer emperor, and large marble statues stand on the platforms behind their stations to ascertain their celestial status, all save for one.
taehyung sees the one seat devoid of all decoration and comfort, situated the furthest from the emperor’s throne.
there is no statue behind it to call for deference, and taehyung feels his feet carry him to his appointed seat for the evening while the silence gradually breaks into hushed scandalized murmurings of incredulity and curiosity.
the crowds of commoners seated in the cavea are openly jeering now, but taehyung is nothing but accustomed to them.
he takes his place on what is a mockery of his throne, given to him not out of any respect for his authority, but with the purpose of having him displayed for open disdain.
jungkook takes his post behind taehyung as his knight, and taehyung lets himself curl into the cold stone of his throne as he watches the doors for the others to appear.
he’s the first to arrive, which does not surprise him, but it gives him a few moments to compose his calm before the trials begin.
he expects—maybe—a few petty charges of infidelity.
cheating wives and sleazy husbands, snide comments and political posturing, everything that has become habitual of these annual trials.
they are exhausting at best, but taehyung has never been interested in studying the ever-changing tides of political powerplay.
for him, it is simply a night of humiliation where he has to clench his teeth and smile through the thinly veiled insults that fly at him as part of the night’s entertainment.
yoongi always says that taehyung isn’t built for politics.
he never means it crudely.
it is said with fondness and a hand that tucks in taehyung’s stubborn hair behind his ear.
an open book, yoongi would always drawl affectionately and with a lilt of guilt.
yoongi is the one suited for politics, and taehyung imagines yoongi in his place.
his brother would never tuck himself into his throne the way taehyung does, shoulders curled in and head bent low, afraid of meeting anybody’s eyes.
no, taehyung imagines yoongi leaning back against the throne like he belongs in it, eyes sharp and lips pulled into a predatory smirk.
with his quick wit and his sharp tongue, taehyung has no doubt that his brother would have everybody sitting straighter in their seats.
but instead of him, it is taehyung wearing his throne like an ill-fitting robe, like a child trying to play king, and yoongi is back at the palace, trying to run the province and keep their people from starving and freezing to death.
the loud sound of the doors opening has taehyung’s head snapping up, fright seizing his senses before he lowers it down once again.
loud footsteps against the marble floor resound through the courtroom as the crowds fall into a revered silence.
taehyung can’t tell how many of them sweep into the room with a careless luxurious grace that he could never afford.
the footsteps eventually disperse as the gods part to take their thrones.
taehyung’s eyes are still lowered, fixed so firmly on his hands resting in his lap, that the sudden pull at his hair takes him by shock.
fingers grab the hair at the back of his neck and firmly yank at them to force taehyung to look up and meet the eyes of the man standing before him.
jimin’s face holds no expression, although taehyung is accustomed to that.
the viscount of venus is donned in loose robes that reveal his pale torso, a stark contrast to the thick black attire that covers every inch of taehyung's skin even in the stifling heat of the court.
gold glitters against his skin, and jimin’s red eyes narrow into slits.
"good to see you," he says, and his face still doesn’t reveal anything, perfected to resemble a stone sculpture.
but taehyung feels his grip on his hair loosen, then soothe where he had pulled.
to anybody spectating from a distance, it would look like an encounter meant to humiliate taehyung.
but out of everybody in the room, jimin is the closest thing to a friend he has.
although, with jimin, he can never tell what he’s really thinking.
the viscount has often sought his company, but taehyung can never tell if jimin just finds him entertaining, or if their relation is something closer to a genuine friendship.
jimin’s hand strokes taehyung’s neck briefly before he retreats his hand, fingers brushing taehyung’s jaw and tilting his chin up in the process.
"keep your head up."
with that, jimin strides away to take his place two thrones away, right beside the emperor.
taehyung watches him sprawl on his throne with an ease that he envies.
it is true that jimin has the emperor’s highest favour, and it would be a joke to say that taehyung has any.
fifteen years ago, pluto was found responsible for leading an attempt to usurp the royal family.
fifteen years ago, taehyung’s father lost the emperor’s favour as well as the sun.
and ever since their disgrace, pluto has lived in an inescapable winter all year long, and all of taehyung and yoongi’s pleas to the empire have been denied, or worse ignored.
despite having his title, taehyung holds no power in the court.
and this display is just to illustrate that.
they give him a seat in this room, but just so he can be openly humiliated and dragged through the mud.
nobody spares taehyung a glance as they sweep into the room and occupy their thrones.
mercury and venus are situated on either side of the emperor.
further away are mars and jupiter, then saturn and uranus, and lastly, neptune and pluto who are positioned right across the room.
the baron of neptune is possibly the only one who matches taehyung’s degree of disinterest in the entire evening.
he sits with his cheek in his palm, eyes lidded with impatience, but taehyung doesn’t fool himself into imagining a camaraderie between them.
taehyung has no allies here, and it’s best that he never forgets that.
there is a long stretch of silence where all eight of them remain seated, unmoving and unspeaking, but it breaks when, all of a sudden, taehyung hears a faint thud in the distance.
he jerks to sit straighter in his seat, and the sound comes again in quick succession.
it sounds like heavy metal colliding against stone, again and again, gaining volume with each impact in the way that only means one thing eyes growing wide, taehyung leans forward in his seat to peer down at the giant stage below the court.
there is a long spiralling staircase that winds straight down into the depths of the mouth of the giant titan snake, ekhis.
it is a prison for only the crudest of crimes.
certainly, no god had committed an offence worthy of being sentenced to that sunless abyss.
but, to his horror, two figures emerge from the stairwell and onto the stage, and taehyung feels his body grow stiff when he recognises the first face.
kim seokjin, an earthling who was granted knighthood by the royal family, is a man who taehyung is deeply familiar with.
seokjin’s face looks grim, frozen to stone, and crushed in his fist is the tail end of a leash.
when taehyung’s gaze travels the length of the leash and meets the face of the man behind seokjin, jungkook’s hand has to grab him hard by the shoulder to keep his body from crumpling and falling to the floor on his knees in utter anguish.
the entire court bursts into an explosion of shocked whispers that spread like waves across the concentric rows of seats in the cavea, but crown prince jung hoseok’s shoulders remain taut and defiant, and his face shows no sign of shame or remorse.
his torso is bare and shows evidence of his time spent in the pits of ekhis’ stomach.
long bloody scars criss-cross across his golden skin, and the tight leash digs into the chafed skin of his throat as he is pulled into the center of the stage, then kicked at the back of his knees.
his armor makes the same loud noise when it collides against the stone floor of the stage, and hoseok falls to his knees, palms splayed out in front of him and his spine curved inward in forced deference.
taehyung can hear himself panting, chest heaving loudly with every sharp breath he inhales.
jungkook’s nails dig harder into his shoulder to keep him composed, and taehyung lets him push him back into his throne, but his eyes don’t move from where hoseok is bent on the floor, the new position revealing yet another mass of deep red mangled wounds on his back.
his attention, however, is snatched when another figure is led onto the stage.
two guards are shoving a man towards the stage, and from his appearance alone, taehyung can make out that this man is an ordinary earthling.
his confusion about the nature of hoseok’s crime only grows when the earthling is led to the center of the stage where a wooden post is dug into the ground.
the post is used for executions, the slow, violent kind—this court’s favourite type of entertainment, and taehyung watches the man step up to the post before the guards behind him begin to tie him to it.
what is the most surprising, however, is when hoseok lifts his head at the sound of the commotion and his eyes catch sight of the newcomer.
a look of pure terror crosses hoseok’s hard features for one fleeting moment, mouth going slack and eyes going wide with horror, before it dissolves into something stormy and rigid.
but that one moment alone tells taehyung the truth of the nature of his transgression.
a god falling in love with a mortal is quite possibly the greatest offence they can commit to their duty, and taehyung finds himself examining the earthling’s features out of some deep vengeful curiosity.
the man looks as if he’s already accepted his fate.
his head hangs low, and his matted and overgrown, dirty locks of hair fall in front of his face and hide his eyes from view.
his arms are bent around the curvature of the wooden post that he is bound to, thick ropes tying the wrists together and keeping him from falling face-first into the floor.
taehyung can tell that the man is handsome despite his downtrodden form, but before he has the chance to examine him any further, the doors to the court open once again.
with an unmistakable distinguished air that radiates regality, the emperor strides inside the room, and he does it with an imposing impression of uncare.
without even a glance in his son’s direction, he settles heavily in his throne on the other end of the room, and everybody in the room seems to sit straighter in their seats as well.
"presenting his imperial majesty, führer emperor sol invictus."
with precision, everybody stands up and bends fully at the waist.
a familiar ache flares up in his side when he follows the etiquette, but taehyung clenches his teeth and keeps his position, clenching his palms into fists to stop himself from reaching down to grab his waist.
the emperor makes an acceding gesture, and taehyung tries not to let the relief show when he slides back down into his seat.
he sees an advocate approach the emperor with a long parchment in his hands before he begins to read the charges against hoseok out loud.
"jung hoseok, the crown prince as well as the general of the imperial army, was accused of being romantically involved with an earthling—" roars of whispers erupt in the courtroom, and immediately, all eyes turn to look at the pitiful man bound to the post.
"kim namjoon," the advocate continues, "who is a scholar under general jung’s command.
he’s also a part of the general’s personal squad.
soldiers who have seen the two interact report that they’ve witnessed their relationship cross what is customary of a superior and subordinate."
"objection," a voice loudly drawls out, and taehyung sees seokjin step up next to the advocate and bow before the emperor.
at the common looks of confusion across the court, seokjin straightens and lifts his hand to introduce himself.
"kim seokjin, lieutenant general of the imperial army and also the defendant’s representative.
general jung has been nothing but dignified in his relationship with kim namjoon.
i’d like to ask a few questions to these supposed witnesses to confirm their credibility."
at the emperor’s assent, the first witness is called to stand before the court.
it is a soldier who had been the first to report the offence to the court.
he is a slight man who carries himself with a confidence that seems to falter when kim seokjin looms over him with an unamused expression.
"could you please tell the court why you felt it necessary to report an improper relationship between the crown prince and scholar kim namjoon?"
the man puffs out his chest, chin high with moral superiority as he announces loudly, "it is a crime of the highest degree.
i felt it was my duty to report it."
"and what gave you reason to believe that such a crime had transpired?"
the man’s mouth purses with displeasure.
"i saw them."
"you saw them?"
seokjin echoes dubiously, eyebrows lifting.
"what, precisely, did you see?"
this time, the man falters slightly, like he hadn’t been prepared to be interrogated about it.
but he regains his footing once again and straightens his shoulders before he speaks.
"i saw scholar kim namjoon leave the general’s personal quarters early in the morning."
seokjin’s lips quirk up slightly, cruelly, like a predator moments away from pouncing atop his prey.
"you witnessed scholar kim leaving the general’s personal quarters early in the morning?"
he asks but doesn’t give the man a chance to respond.
"in other words, you didn’t truly witness anything incriminating?
your claim was based entirely on speculation?"
the man suddenly looks discomposed.
"n-no," he stammers, "i mean, general jung never lets mortals enter his personal quarters.
i’m being honest.
we have all tried to gain his favour, at some point or another.
but he never let anybody else enter his quarters.
only scholar kim was on the receiving end of the special treatment.
it wasn’t hard to see that they had an unusual relationship."
"special treatment?
please elaborate."
"there are several instances, like whenever there was a conflict between the strategists, the general always chose to side with scholar kim’s argument.
everybody knew that he was his favourite."
seokjin makes a thoughtful humming sound as he rubs at his chin with his finger.
despite the act, taehyung knows that he needs to do no amount of thinking.
he’s got the witness right where he wants him.
"let me clarify one thing," seokjin looks up at the man, voice deceptively neutral, "what do you mean when you said that all of you tried to gain his favor?
did the others fancy the general?"
"i mean—" the man looks flustered, "it’s no secret.
everyone in his squad fancied him.
but we never stood a chance."
"so, all of you fancied the crown prince.
and kim namjoon was favoured by him.
please excuse me, but from where i stand, it seems to me that your claim was clouded by your envy of kim namjoon."
"i would never—" the man starts to refute, face aghast, but seokjin’s got his claws in him.
"you despised namjoon because general jung favoured him over the lot of you," he cuts the man off, voice raising, "and when you spotted him leave the general’s quarters, your jealousy caused you to fabricate claims that you did not bother to confirm."
the man gapes at him, but seokjin cares little for that as he twists around to face the emperor abruptly.
"your royal highness, i do not believe this man’s claims hold any credence.
they’re founded on the man’s affections for the crown prince, and his envy of scholar kim namjoon."
the emperor has his elbow propped on the armrest, and his cheek rests on his fist with an uncaring ease as he makes an impatient gesture at seokjin, as if telling him to move past the theatrics and go on.
the process repeats as seokjin tears apart the second witness as well, humiliating them in public and questioning their claim’s credibility.
the third and final witness is the washerwoman who washes the soldiers’ clothing.
"i never scrutinise the men’s garments," she begins nervously, most definitely worried that seokjin will go down that route, "but it took me by surprise when i found the general’s clothes mixed with another man’s."
"and that was surprising to you because?"
the woman seems to shrink into herself at seokjin’s sharp tone.
"it—i—" she stammers, shoulders shrivelling and chin pressed firmly to her sternum, "i saw some unsavory stains on them."
taehyung clenches his fingers that are fisted tight in the fabric of his robes, but seokjin doesn’t seem like the admission took him by surprise.
"right," he drawls.
"lady oh, wasn’t it?"
"yes?"
"i brought the camp’s healer here to confirm my claims, but have you or have you not seen the healer due to your poor eyesight?"
"that has no—" "yes or no, please."
"yes, but—" "that’ll suffice.
my second question to you is: have you or have you not received complaints by the gentlemen who sometimes received garments that did not belong to them?"
when the woman doesn’t answer, seokjin raises an eyebrow and looks up from the parchment in his hands and at her.
"lady oh?
will you give your answer?"
when she doesn’t respond, can’t even get herself to look up with how much she’s trembling, seokjin sighs.
"there were complaints regarding your disassortment of the soldiers’ clothing, which is why you had decided to visit the healer.
with such frequent precedents of your poor performance, would it not be reasonable to doubt whether the clothes you claim belong to the crown prince and kim namjoon truly belonged to them?"
the woman is shaking, lips quivering to hold back all noise, and taehyung wonders how long it would drag on.
as it plays out, he doesn’t have to wait much longer, because the emperor lifts a hand, and immediately, all eyes turn to look at him as if out of innate obedience.
"seokjin-ah, i commend your efforts to save my son.
thank you.
but this is rather unnecessary.
let us not humiliate these good people any further.
there are easier ways to find the truth."
he then lets his eyes slide to look down at the stage where hoseok’s spine is still bent fully, his forehead touching the ground before him.
"you say you do not hold any emotion of affection for this man?"
the entire room falls silent as they watch hoseok slowly get his elbows on the floor and push himself up so he stares back at his father.
taehyung holds his breath "no," hoseok says, the first time he’s spoken during the night.
the wind is strong and cool against her cheeks, and yoongi’s bangs fall into her eyes, obscuring her view of the boy stood before her, wringing his fingers where he’s got them clasped before him in nervousness.
taehyung, as he’d quietly introduced himself to her after he rushed out of the cafe doors behind her, looks up at yoongi from between his lashes.
tall, sloping nose-bridge, a soft dip of his upper lip, a single double-lid mirroring yoongi’s own.
he’s pretty, impossibly.
"is this a prank?"
yoongi’s voice comes out sharper than she'd intended it to be, and she watches taehyung flinch slightly, but she pushes on, slightly irritated but mostly incredulous, "did your friends dare you to chase me out here and ask me out?
are they recording this somewhere?"
when yoongi leans to the side to search for the friends that she’s certain are hiding in the cafe or in the street adjacent to it, with their phones out and smirks etched to their lips, taehyung’s hands shoot out as if to hold yoongi by the shoulders, but they freeze before his fingers make contact with the fabric of yoongi’s dress.
yoongi returns to her original orientation and watches as taehyung retreats his hands shamefully.
his head is bent, eyes now firmly pinned to the pavement, and yoongi watches him bite his lip and speak, quietly and carefully.
"it’s—it’s not a prank.
we were in the experimental sound workshop together.
you were cute, and i—i like you..."
he trails off, and yoongi considers him for a long moment.
taehyung grows more hesitant as the silence stretches, shoulders curling inwards and bangs now hanging off his forehead, long enough to conceal his eyes.
there is nothing to consider, and yoongi straightens herself, pulling herself out of the careless slouch and gripping the cup of coffee in her hand with more force.
"i’m sorry, but it’s a no from me."
that has taehyung’s head snapping up to meet yoongi’s eyes.
yoongi keeps her face expressionless, even as taehyung looks crushed, eyes growing wider the longer yoongi speaks.
"we’ve never even spoken.
you don’t know me.
so you can’t like me.
you thought i looked nice, which basically translates to you wanted to hookup with me," taehyung’s lips part, as if to protest, but yoongi goes on, "but i don’t do hookups.
hell, i don’t even look like this on most days."
she gestures towards her dress and watches taehyung’s wide eyes roam across her nicest outfit—a short yellow sundress, tight at the chest and flaring under it—before snapping back to yoongi’s face.
it’s true.
this is quite possibly the dressiest she’s looked in her entire postgrad year, and there’s no significant reason for it either.
she had a study date with a classmate who'd bailed after yoongi already ordered her coffee, so she has already deemed the trip wasted and had marched out of the cafe to return to the studio where she could get some work done before the day ended for good.
but now she’s stood before a cute guy, turning him down because the opposite just seems too fanciful, something she would usually only just dream about for a minute before her pragmatic nature would squash it.
"i’m sorry, i don’t have a single reason to say yes."
taehyung looks down again, and absently, yoongi thinks he looks like a dejected puppy, but she wills herself to remain strong.
she thinks he’s about to give up, and he should.
yoongi despises men who cannot take a no.
but something about taehyung has already started to melt her.
he’s handsome, in a way that yoongi never thought to see together in the same frame as herself.
she isn’t blind, but she isn’t stupid either.
she knows better than to accept advances like this; confessions from strangers, she knows better than to set herself up like that.
"you’re right," taehyung speaks, and it pulls yoongi out of her thoughts.
"we don’t know each other.
but, can i try?
can i try to get to know you?"
yoongi squeezes her eyes shut, feeling her stomach tightening and sinking.
like she hadn’t heard that before countless times.
she opens her eyes and finds taehyung watching her face hopefully, and yoongi has been keeping track of everywhere taehyung’s gaze has roamed across her body.
not once have his eyes stopped at her chest, and it makes her fingers clench her cup tighter.
the bar is so low, she berates herself, but it’s better than anybody she’s been with.
taehyung is still watching her, round eyes going rounder, the evening sun melting in the distance and pouring across taehyung’s skin, painting it orange and golden.
she already knows it’s a mistake before the words pour out of her, a familiar dread cementing under her skin as the knowledge of inevitable destruction looms on the horizon.
"here’s what we’re going to do."
taehyung’s eyes are wide and alert, and yoongi is a fool.
"there’s a subway not far from here.
we’re going to go there and you’re going to pay for my sandwich and we can talk.
if, after an hour, you still want to date me, and i want to see you again, we can do that.
is that okay?"
taehyung’s responding smile is wide, bigger than his face, and he doesn’t even try to hide or downplay his excitement as he nods.
yoongi shouldn’t find it as endearing as she does.
but the dread tightening her stomach slowly loosens as they walk along the street together, and when taehyung weaves their fingers together, a sheepish grin and question in his eyes, yoongi allows him.
and when he stops to pet three different dogs on their way, yoongi allows that too, provided that taehyung’s fingers gravitate back to the gaps between her own.
when their mini-date ends and taehyung, hesitantly, asks if he can leave his number with yoongi, yoongi lets him.
and when he leans down to kiss yoongi on the cheek, yoongi lets him do that too.
and if yoongi texts him at night, a simple: "it was fun, thanks.
when’s our next date?"
then nobody has to know.
rain pours down on them with the force of a torrent of pellets, and taehyung’s arms tighten painfully around yoongi's waist.
yoongi grits his teeth but holds his tongue.
the proximity cannot be avoided since it was yoongi's own carelessness that caused his horse to be robbed two days into their trip.
now taehyung's horse has to bear both of their weight, and yoongi feels too aware of his husband's wet body pressed so entirely against his, his front curved over yoongi's back and their thighs slotted together intimately, and yoongi has never before been so conscious of the difference in their bodies.
but where taehyung’s thighs are broad and tan, built with hardened muscles suited for horseback riding, yoongi’s thighs are thin and pale, appearing almost fragile when caged inside taehyung’s spread legs.
the silence between them hangs heavier than the storm, broken only by the roaring thunder above their heads.
but as much as yoongi doesn't want to be the one to break the frosty silence that has followed them for the better part of their day, they've been trudging in the storm for nearly an hour and yoongi desperately wants to suggest that they camp under the shade of a tree instead of searching for an inn.
they've gotten into arguments before; yoongi can hardly recall them conversing during the first few days without it escalating into raised voices and poorly concealed taunts, but none of them have been quite like this.
their fights are loud.
taehyung, from what little yoongi has learnt of him in the few weeks they've spent in close quarters, is prone to emotional outbursts.
where yoongi bottles everything inside him till no evidence of it can be seen on his face, taehyung bursts out like a dam, loud and open and honest.
it's a privilege, in yoongi's brutal opinion, to be able to be so expressive.
yoongi, on the other hand, has been disciplined to mask every fibre of discomfort, irritation, and anger in his body.
but taehyung is silent now, and for some reason, it is even more telling of his emotions.
"i can see an inn up ahead," taehyung suddenly breaks the silence between them for the first time after hours, having to shout to be heard over the roar of the storm, and yoongi lifts his head and tries to see what taehyung is speaking of, but it's hard to spot anything in the dark with rainwater spilling into his eyes.
however, it seems like taehyung speaks the truth because as they draw closer, the trees thin out and yoongi can make out the dark building erected up ahead of them.
it's not too big, but yoongi is far from complaining.
he feels taehyung press his legs tighter against his horse, and the horse quickens its pace as taehyung leads it towards the inn.
it isn’t far, and taehyung and yoongi are quick to dismount the horse to enter the blissful shade that the inn provides.
from there, taehyung takes over.
he unwraps his own black robes to cover yoongi’s shivering body, and even though yoongi would typically scorn such a gesture, he settles for nodding once, jerkily, in gratitude as the violent shivers wrack his body.
hesitance pulls at taehyung’s brows when he has to leave yoongi alone at the threshold while he speaks with the innkeeper, but yoongi pushes him lightly at the chest, and taehyung twists around to approach the innkeeper.
their conversation is brief, and yoongi can already tell its outcome from the tight set of taehyung’s jaw, before his husband, ultimately, bows once in gratitude and returns to yoongi’s side with a somber face and a set of dry clothes in his arms.
"he says they do not have room for us, but he shall let us have the barn and a tub of warm water for the night."
it is not ideal, but yoongi is nodding anyway.
it is not as if their journey has been a luxury so far.
yoongi is no stranger to hardship, but he would give just about anything to be able to shed his soaked robes and ease into a tub of warm water to soothe the shivers.
when the innkeeper points towards the barn, taehyung and yoongi make a run for its shade and secure the horse to the post outside, under the awning just big enough to shelter it from the weather.
the innkeeper’s wife brings the warm water to them, and taehyung awkwardly turns around and gives yoongi as much privacy as their lodging allows, while yoongi sheds the clothes stuck to every inch of his body.
with each layer that peels off his skin, yoongi feels all the more aware of the little distance between him and his husband.
they’ve never seen each other without clothes before even though yoongi had prepared himself for the moment before their marriage.
but his husband has been unlike all that yoongi thought and expected of him.
truthfully, yoongi hadn’t expected much.
each time he catches sight of the hard fury lining hoseok’s tight jaw while the older man jerks open the various pockets and flaps in his rucksack in search for his medical supplies, taehyung shrinks further into himself where he’s awkwardly perched at the edge of hoseok’s bed.
anger is not a look the corporal bares on his face often.
he’s known for his sunny disposition across their company, even on the training ring where his smiles are more terrifying than comforting, but it is also why the knowledge that his anger is directed at him makes taehyung want to dig a hole into the ground and bury his head in it, just for a little while.
the silence hangs heavy in the tent, and taehyung’s stomach churns with dread.
he’s almost forgotten about the scrapes on his face until he sees hoseok return with a wet cloth, bandages, and ointment, and just the sight of him has taehyung straightening his spine out of habit.
hoseok sits on the bed in front of taehyung, close enough for their knees to touch, and taehyung doesn’t meet his eyes, gaze fixed on the floor until he feels familiar fingers on his chin, firmly pulling his face up.
"i’m not upset," hoseok starts once taehyung looks at him, but taehyung stares at his thin lips curled in a triangle of displeasure and remains unconvinced.
hoseok rolls his eyes slightly, then taps at taehyung’s chin with a finger.
taehyung obediently lifts it, and hoseok brings the wet cloth to his jaw, cleaning the dirt and dried blood there.
"i’m not upset with you," hoseok clarifies with a sigh, voice now betraying his exhaustion.
"i just don’t want you throwing yourself headfirst at every bastard out there."
taehyung feels his cheeks burn at the obvious chastisement.
but he’s stubborn, and he clenches his teeth against the sting of the wet cloth grazing torn skin before biting out, "so i shouldn’t have done that?"
hoseok’s hand pauses very briefly before he starts cleaning the cut above his eyebrow, silent until he finishes.
"no.
i don’t think you needed to do that," he responds calmly.
taehyung feels the storm that has been brewing under his skin all this time flare out unbridled.
"so those assholes," he grits out and watches hoseok pull away till they’re staring at each other with matching muted fury, "can do whatever the fuck they want, and i should—what?
let them think they can get away with it?"
hoseok’s face is hard, tension coiled in the lines of his features, until he squeezes his eyes shut and schools it into something that’s more familiar to taehyung.
when he looks at taehyung again, he looks tired.
he’s not that much older than him, but something about him makes him feel distant by years, the jaded lines in his face speaking of the years of battles that taehyung, with his born privilege, would never have to face.
"the world is filled with assholes," hoseok says now, exhausted.
"how many of them will you fight, huh?
till they break you?
it’s not worth it."
taehyung believes him, but he can’t accept it.
not when his fists are stained with the blood of men who believe status is above all skill, who, just by virtue of their birth and a physiology that gives them a knot, believe that they’re entitled to question the authority and competence of everybody not born the same as them.
"you really think i was being ridiculous?
impulsive?"
hoseok doesn’t respond right away.
taehyung watches the scarring on his ear where a bullet had once grazed him years ago, mere centimeters from his skull.
once hoseok starts to clean the skin around his eyes, taehyung lets them fall shut.
when he pulls them open again, hoseok is watching him with an inscrutable emotion in his eyes.
the dim evening light has softened the scars on his face, making him look less like the veteran fighter that he is, but more like the man that taehyung has gradually, inescapably fallen in love with.
"you have a big, bleeding heart, taehyung-ah."
there is a fondness in hoseok’s voice, but taehyung can’t help but tense up at the words.
"but the world isn’t built as kind.
you should know that."
"so, then—childish?"
taehyung grits out.
"you think i’m being childish."
hoseok sighs, shuddering out a tired exhale, and he drops the wet cloth now.
picking up the ointment, he squeezes out some of it on his finger before gently applying it where taehyung’s skin has torn open.
taehyung hisses but holds still for hoseok’s careful hands.
"you know that’s not what i mean.
it’s just not worth you getting hurt."
from the outside, it may seem like hoseok wears his heart on his sleeve, sunny smiles on his face and easy affection in his touches.
but taehyung knows him a bit better now.
after a year spent training under him, and nights spent panting into his mouth, he knows how rarely hoseok lets his vulnerabilities show.
he’s good at hiding them under inches of thick skin, even better at tactfully keeping people at a distance.
an enigma concealed under a deceptive film of sunlit smiles.
but taehyung is observant.
and hoseok’s fists, his delicate, deadly hands, had shaken the entire time he’d pulled taehyung away from the band of knotheads and dragged him into his personal tent.
even now, his shoulders have a defensive curve to them, everything about him subdued and muted, and the sight only hardens taehyung’s resolve.
"you’re worth it," taehyung whispers, then lifts his chin in defiance and reverence, both in equal measures, as he stares at hoseok and closes his fingers around hoseok’s wrist, bringing those hardened knuckles to his lips and kissing them, voice firmer when he clarifies, "you’re worth fighting for."
hoseok’s mouth parts slightly in flustered surprise, but then he’s raising an imperious eyebrow, lips twitching into an amused smile.
"am i now?"
intimidated, but not easily shaken, taehyung grins big and boxy.
he leans forward, still gripping hoseok’s hand tight with his own as he presses his cold lips to the prominent bone of hoseok’s cheek.
"you are," he whispers close to his scarred ear, briefly tracing the roughened skin there before hoseok jerks his hand out of taehyung’s hold and slaps at his chest hard, pushing him back.
"stay still," hoseok mutters, and his ears burn red.
taehyung smiles so wide and giddy, his cheeks ache.
he does remain still for hoseok to dress his wounds, and the older man remains silent the entire time.
it takes so long that, ultimately, taehyung realises hoseok is teasing him.
grabbing hoseok’s wrists in his hands, taehyung looks at him straight in the eye, unamused, and hoseok’s mask breaks in an instant as he bursts into a full-bodied cackling laugh.
"you big baby," he says, smiling, before finally, finally, leaning in to press their mouths together, and taehyung releases his wrists in favour of sliding them up his arms, his shoulders, the sides of his neck, until he can cup hoseok’s face in his hands and brush his thumbs against his cheeks.
and suddenly he can’t contain the depths of his emotions, wants no longer to keep it to himself.
it’s redundant, his feelings are surely fairly obvious to hoseok by now, but he wants to say it anyway—his chest is going to burst open if he doesn’t.
"i love you," he whispers into the kiss, breathless, and when hoseok pulls away, he doesn’t look surprised even though these are uncharted waters between them, feelings that neither of them had confessed because attachment is a foolish soldier’s mistake and war is never generous to anybody.
yet— "i love you too," hoseok is breathing into his mouth, and taehyung feels all air leave him.
"so don’t fight for me, mm?
i’m already yours."
that’s not what taehyung meant, and they both know it.
but before taehyung can make a sound, hoseok is pulling him closer and pressing their foreheads together before he seals taehyung’s lips shut again with his own.
yoongi is dragged from his slumber with soft kisses and dry lips that descend down the slope of his neck.
he hums deep in his chest, eyelids still heavy and weighed down by the fog of sleep as the kisses slowly grow more insistent and sloppy.
when he tries to shift, he finds his wrists are pinned to the bed above him.
there is a weight on his chest, and it has his eyelids lifting, blinking as his sight gradually adjusts to the dark.
neck twisted to the side, yoongi sees his husband on the other end of the bed.
taehyung is lying on his side, robes parting to reveal a golden chest and an elbow propping him up as he too watches yoongi with lidded eyes.
if his husband isn’t who is lying on top of him, then— "yoongi, sweetheart," a sweet voice croons in his ear, and it is as frightening as it is familiar.
"won’t you look at me?"
stiff with dread and anticipation, yoongi slowly twists his head to the side and comes face to face with those flat black eyes that reflect no light.
seokjin’s lips stretch unnaturally wide, like a knife sliced the corners of his lips even further, revealing a row of glittering teeth behind them.
and yoongi has to remind himself to breathe when seokjin’s tongue twists and swipes at his gums that are lined red with blood.
"did you miss me, darling?"
his voice is a melodic breathy whisper, a cheap imitation of what it used to be.
even his face holds none of seokjin’s warmth, so cold and hard, the once handsome features now haunting.
because this is the truth: this isn’t seokjin, the man whom yoongi once loved and lost.
this isn’t him.
yet, it is his face, his voice, his body and his touch that haunts yoongi every twenty-seventh moonturn.
and when those cold fingers slide down yoongi’s ribs, his hips and his thighs, nails dig into flesh, and he hisses.
"speak to me, love."
the voice says, so sweet despite the threat.
this seokjin isn’t as patient, yoongi has had to learn.
this seokjin likes to leave imprints of his touch on yoongi’s body, fingers around his throat and thin crescents of nails on his thighs that last the days until he visits them again.
taehyung’s stare bores into the side of his face, and like always, it has yoongi’s breaths come out sharper in his throat, harsher.
"i did," he whispers into the dark, breathless, but his chin is being jerked up until he’s forced to meet seokjin’s lifeless eyes.
"what was that?
louder please, sweetheart."
"i m-missed you," yoongi stutters, and he watches as grim satisfaction settles on seokjin’s face, briefly, before those red lips twist cruelly again.
"are you quite certain?"
the words are accompanied by one of seokjin’s hands slipping down between his legs, and when two of his fingers abruptly sink inside yoongi’s entrance that’s still loose and wet with taehyung’s cum, he sneers, "it seems like you’ve been occupied without me."
yoongi’s thighs squeeze close out of instinct, but seokjin’s hands are immediately forcing them apart.
his strength crushes all of yoongi’s weak attempts at resistance, and yoongi is helplessly bent in half when seokjin slaps both of his thighs against his torso.
he can’t move, pinned to the bed and folded in half, can’t do much other than groan when seokjin pulls his fingers out of him and replaces them with his thick cock.
yoongi screams then, his throat hoarse from sliding ceaselessly on taehyung’s cock earlier in the night.
the ache of being filled so full, he doesn’t expect it.
seokjin was always so big—and when he slams into him in one solid thrust, bottoming out immediately, yoongi’s spine bows off the bed, a pained cry caught in his throat before it could leave him.
seokjin slides out of him and kicks his hips forward again, pelvis meeting the curve of yoongi’s ass, and yoongi crumbles into a trembling, sobbing mess underneath him.
"look at your husband," seokjin purrs in his ear, voice hot and moist, and yoongi’s head is slammed onto its side till his neck is twisted and he’s staring at taehyung’s deep and dark, stormy eyes.
"give him a show, yeah?
show him how good i fuck you."
the whimper spills from yoongi’s pliant lips before he can stop it.
seokjin’s cock is so thick, he can’t help himself; each brutal thrust makes yoongi feel like he’ll rip open at the seams.
and he claws at the bedsheets, twists and thrashes as he sobs, while the dark fury on taehyung’s face only grows, lining the edges of his hard jaw.
seokjin fucks him relentlessly, slamming into him so hard, yoongi’s body is thrown back a few inches each time, only held in place by seokjin’s fingers pinning his wrists above him.
the entire time, yoongi stares at taehyung through the blur of the tears that stream down his cheeks.
his husband doesn’t speak a word; he never does on these nights.
but the rage is evident on his face even in the dark.
and by the time seokjin is done with him, disappearing into ill-lit night with the promise of returning once the moon completes its next circle, yoongi can’t make a sound, throat so dry and arms so weak, he can’t push taehyung away when his husband climbs over him and out of jealousy—or a petty possessiveness, yoongi doesn’t know—cleaves him open once more to have his turn.
as winter approaches, daylight grows precious, and the dark crawls in quick and eager.
yoongi tries to keep his panic from swelling when he sees no sign of taehyung’s return from the forest.
the sky is a dull gray, too dark to be cloudy but too pale to be night, and yoongi’s fingers shake with the urgency to lock the doors and windows, but he curls them into fists and focuses on preparing the chicken for dinner.
to lock the house when the daylight dies is an unspoken rule.
if one of them doesn’t return by nightfall, then there’s a good chance that they aren’t returning at all.
but things are different now, yoongi reminds himself and grits his teeth as the stove sputters and the gas catches alight.
the two of them are no longer strangers trying to survive on the desolate wasteland of seoul.
they have a house, a farm, and a life together.
things are different now.
he sets the pot of water to boil.
they’ve been running low on firewood and the approaching winter is going to be brutal, which is why taehyung had ventured into the forest early in the day, braving his boots and the morning chill as he hung his axe over his shoulder and disappeared between the thicket of long dark trees.
he hasn’t returned still, and the house feels eerie without taehyung to fill the air in it with mindless chatter or the soft hum of a song he remembered from the past.
his husband has always been the one to fill in the silent vacuums between them with conversation.
it is a little needless since it’s just the two of them in the house and little happens in their day, but yoongi has learnt that loneliness is a disease as deadly as any, and the two of them only have each other, so taehyung talks.
he talks about his plans to further the farm, about the weather and the wind and what they’d bode for them.
he’ll often talk about the little musings in his head, and sometimes, on rare occasions, he’ll speak about the people from his past.
a boy and friend, jimin.
a boy and lover, hoseok.
they haven’t heard from or about either of them in years, which really only ever means one thing, but yoongi hears taehyung fiddling with the radio every other week anyway.
the house feels so still without all of that noise, and yoongi can feel the silence encroaching on him.
he feels like he should be bracing for something, but he doesn’t know what.
the forest beyond the windows is dark, long thin trees rising from the ground like the dead, and yoongi checks the sky again for the fifth time in the past ten minutes.
the light is going to die completely in an hour’s time, and whatever beasts reside inside the forest will come out to hunt.
yoongi’s fingers come to touch his hip instinctively, feeling the long dark scar throb once again in phantom ache.
it stretches from his hip bone and runs all the way across the underside of his stomach, an injury that would’ve certainly killed him if taehyung hadn’t dragged his body back to the house in time.
what beasts live in the forests, yoongi doesn’t know.
all he knows is that this earth is no longer hospitable to them and that humans are a dying breed.
yoongi honestly can’t recall when he last saw one of their own, somebody that wasn’t taehyung or his late grandfather.
perhaps in seoul, but seoul is a wasteland like all big cities are.
the apocalypse wiped out all urban life, and the cities where humans once thrived have now become wastelands.
the few survivors like them have taken to self-sustaining agrarian lifestyles outside the cities.
yoongi had escaped to the outskirts of daegu two years ago, where he found taehyung and his grandfather on their farm.
most of their helpers had fled to their families so yoongi had offered to work for them on their fields in exchange for food.
the farm isn’t as big as it used to be, but taehyung has been preserving it the best he can since his grandfather's passing.
the last few months have been better than what they’ve seen in years.
the earth is healing slowly, and watching taehyung’s bright smile as he tells yoongi about everything he plans to grow in their fields with wild animated gestures has yoongi also hoping that maybe the coming years wouldn't be too bad to them.
nothing in the universe is static.
their universe is constantly moving, often at the speeds of hundreds of thousands of kilometers per second.
billions of stars in the milky way alone are continuously careening through the galaxy, and it is only the vast distance between these celestial objects that protects humanity on their tiny speck of a planet from a giant supernova exploding nearby or a shower of asteroids brought about by the gravity of a passing brown dwarf.
that is, until it didn't protect them.
until that which was presumed by astrophysicists to have the odds of occurring of a one in a hundred thousand, in the next five billion years, came true.
the end of the world became their reality, but not in any way that adventurous authors and film screenwriters had speculated.
there was no vicious virus let loose, no extra-terrestrial invasion, no unhinged scientists or an artificially intelligent army developing a desire for retribution.
no, all it took was a red dwarf—a star about half the size of the sun—passing through the inner solar system for all careful threads and knots of gravity to come loose.
planets and asteroids that had previously orbited the sun in safe and predictable courses were sent careening in careless directions, and earth—the earth was pulled away and ejected from the solar system.
they’d seen it coming obviously, years in advance, but more time has never meant much to humankind in general.
no matter the scale of the danger, humans are sickeningly only concerned with personal gain.
and getting all of humanity to mobilize in one direction was a task close to impossible, especially when their political leaders cared more for their short-sighted affluence than the public good, their religious leaders perceived all scientific dangers as a threat to their own authority, and dogpiling on social media was seen as the paragon of morally excellent activism.
still, all that is easier seen and said in hindsight, yoongi supposes, but all of his thoughts are abruptly brought to a stop when taehyung pulls him impossibly closer to himself.
his arms wrap tighter around yoongi’s waist, and their skins stick so close together, their cold breaths intermingle.
pressed against each other so entirely, from their tangled toes and entwined legs to their glued chests and foreheads as they slowly dip in and out of a hazy and hazardous sleep, when yoongi flutters his eyes open after what was half a feverish fitful doze and half a numbing cold paralysis, taehyung is watching him intently and so lovingly, as if he’s trying to memorise the sweep of each of his eyelashes.
he’s always teased yoongi for his inability to keep eye-contact with him for longer than a meagre few seconds.
but, now, yoongi doesn’t look away.
he splays out his long fingers where they rest across the warm skin on taehyung’s back as he looks at taehyung, at his face that glows a dim golden in the light of the muted fire they’d lit hours prior, before they ran out of things to burn.
they’re huddled under blankets now, wrapped in an embrace to share whatever body heat they can spare.
the room is dark, silent and heavy, only the sounds of their shallow breaths to be heard, and yoongi can make out a vague outline of taehyung’s limbs entangled with his own, unable to tell where one ends and the other starts.
"hyung," taehyung says softly, into the air between them, and the deep sound rumbles through yoongi’s chest where taehyung has tightly held him against himself.
yoongi makes a soft hum in his throat.
it’s so dry, it hurts when he swallows.
he can’t remember when he last drank water.
without the sunlight to evaporate water, the clouds can’t form and the water cycle has stopped entirely.
yoongi smacks his dry lips and tries to wet them with his equally parched tongue.
taehyung doesn’t respond though, and yoongi can’t moisten his lips for shit.
the air is dry and thick, and yoongi is inhaling all of taehyung’s exhales.
taehyung’s hair tickles the tip of his nose, and when taehyung shifts and props himself up on an elbow, it hangs around his face in long and thick, curly black waves.
yoongi feels a deep inexplicable urge to touch it, to card his fingers through it, even though he knows it’s been unwashed for days, but both of them are past that degree of care now.
besides, he can tell that taehyung needs to be touched right now, in that deep-chested desperate way where his voice grows thick and shaky until yoongi doesn’t take him in his arms.
yoongi is no stranger to those moments himself, when his ribs would threaten to splinter under the weight of his emotions and the impending unspoken doom bearing down heavy on their chests.
borrowed time—they’re living on borrowed time.
and it’s about to run out, but neither of them says it; instead yoongi twists his body around, untangling himself from taehyung’s limbs in the process, until his back is flat against the mattress and taehyung is looming over him, elbows on either side of yoongi’s head.
from above, the fire’s warm sheen cascades across taehyung’s face, casting shadows that accentuate the sharp cut of his jaw, his long lashes.
and his lips part again, tremble in that soft-spoken plea when he says, "hyung, can i—" and yoongi lets out a rough, shaky exhale, equally as desperate when lifts a palm that curves around taehyung’s neck and gently pulls him down.
"c’mere," he whispers, and taehyung is just as pliant.
lowering himself on his elbows till their faces are close enough, he presses that sweet mouth against yoongi’s, only chastely pressing their dry lips together at first, before he takes yoongi’s upper lip between his own and kisses it.
the kiss is tender, so much love and desperation in it that yoongi’s chest aches.
the sounds of their lips smacking grow louder, and yoongi slides his fingers into taehyung’s hair, fisting it and gasping into the kiss when taehyung licks into the seam between his lips.
"want to—ah," taehyung breathes, words cut off by a moan, and then he’s pushing past yoongi’s slack lips with his tongue.
yoongi lets him.
he moans into the kiss, legs kicking slightly and fingers pulling taehyung closer by the grip in his hair.
"want to fu—ck, want to take care of you."
taehyung stops kissing him to latch onto his chin, sloppily mouthing at the skin and stubble there, and yoongi shivers against taehyung’s broader body when teeth scrape against the gentle slope of his jaw and bite at the sensitive skin below his ear.
"yes," yoongi says on a harsh exhale, "fuck, yes."
his voice, that was already rough from the dryness in his throat, sounds absolutely wrecked right now, breathless from the way taehyung mouths languidly at the skin behind his ear and then laves his tongue over its shell.
the wet warmth against his cold ears shoots a sensation all the way down to yoongi’s toes.
he stopped wearing earrings months ago so he wouldn’t catch frostbite, but he still finds his breath catching each time taehyung’s tongue licks at the small holes there.
"fuck," he breathes when taehyung closes his lips around the lobe and gives it a suck, thighs tightening and hips kicking up out of instinct.
but taehyung doesn’t meet him.
lifting himself further up on his elbows and grabbing yoongi’s chin between a thumb and a knuckle, he twists it to the side to gain access to the hidden skin on the side of his throat before pressing his hungry mouth to it.
a soft high-pitched moan leaves yoongi’s lips when taehyung’s teeth catch a pinch of the skin and nip it gently, and he curls his fingers impossibly tighter in taehyung’s hair, not pulling him away but keeping him there, holding him there as his body trembles.
he presses his head into the pillow, where taehyung keeps it twisted away, mouth parted open as he pants.
despite the extreme cold, his body heats up like a furnace where taehyung’s skin touches his own.
"tae," he calls out softly in between the erratic heaves of his chest.
"please—ah," he doesn’t know what he’s asking for, but taehyung seems to sense his need because he lets go of his chin and slides his fingers along yoongi’s jaw until he’s cradling his cheek in his palm and gently guiding yoongi back to meet his gaze.
taehyung’s eyes swim with that dusky fondness yoongi's grown familiar with over the years, and his thumb strokes the apple of yoongi’s cheek.
yoongi loosens his hold on taehyung’s hair.
"kiss me," he requests, and taehyung’s lips pull into a slow affectionate smile.
even in the dark, yoongi can see the mole under his lips stretch with the pull before taehyung’s soft mouth captures his own again.
he kisses him sweetly, pressing smiles against yoongi’s open mouth.
but yoongi is feverish with want.
he pulls taehyung closer and kisses him harder, deeper.
then they’re kissing with wet smacks, soft gasps and groans that get swallowed in their mouths.
taehyung’s palm holds yoongi hard, fingers and blunt nails pressing into the swell of his cheek, like he’s afraid yoongi will disappear if he lets go.
and yoongi continues to kiss him with equal amounts of desperate devotion, till his thighs are trembling and taehyung’s growing arousal becomes evident against yoongi’s abdomen.
yoongi’s head jerks back for air, and he allows himself one long look at taehyung’s wet supple mouth, his lips that are swollen and cherry-red, glistening in the feeble yellow light, before he drags him back for more until he’s certain that they both taste the same.
tongues sliding against each other, yoongi’s mouth falls open when taehyung rolls down his hips to meet his own.
taehyung shoves his tongue in over yoongi’s.
"fu—ck, yeah, shit—yeah—" yoongi’s words get lost in taehyung’s mouth as taehyung starts a rhythm against the mattress.
the noise in their room grows, and the darkness gets filled with the wet sounds of their tongues, the bed’s weak whines, and taehyung and yoongi’s groans.
taehyung drags the palm on yoongi’s cheek down the length of his throat until it rests on the flat plane of his chest, and yoongi inhales sharply when taehyung strokes and bends one of his nipples with his thumb.
it hardens under his touch, and soon enough taehyung’s mouth follows his hand.
he ducks down and lowers himself on the other nipple, laving over the bud in broad and flat, hard strokes.
he takes his time teasing yoongi, flicking the blade of his tongue over the nub again and again, while his hand plays with yoongi’s other nipple, bending and rolling it between his fingers.
yoongi’s throat hurts but he can’t keep quiet.
his hands leave taehyung’s hair and clutch onto the sheets instead when taehyung’s lips close around his nipple and suckle at it.
he feels himself growing wet, something he hadn’t thought possible with how dehydrated his body is, but pleasure wracks through his body when he feels the quick hot sting of teeth that taehyung immediately soothes with his tongue.
"taehyung c’mon," yoongi quietly cries, writhing against taehyung’s body, and lifting himself up on one elbow, taehyung returns to yoongi to press their lips together in a hard kiss while his other hand slides further down to the hot, damp skin of yoongi’s abdomen to keep him still.
taehyung kisses him hotly, swallowing down all of his moans and molding their mouths together with an aching pressure.
when yoongi tries to cant up his hips into his palm, taehyung firmly pushes him down into the mattress.
"let me take care of you," he gasps into the kiss before pushing himself on his knees and holding yoongi’s thighs in his hands.
the blankets slide all the way off them, and pulling yoongi’s thighs out from under him, taehyung lifts them and spreads yoongi open.
yoongi shivers a little when the cold air hits his body, but taehyung’s body is immediately curving over him, and the familiar weight presses yoongi deeper into the mattress.
"i love you," taehyung whispers into yoongi’s mouth just as one of his fingers enters him between his folds.
it has yoongi breathing hard and bowing off the bed.
he clenches against taehyung’s finger, eyes pressing shut when taehyung speaks again.
"you look so beautiful, darling."
his words carry his gentle reverence, and yoongi bites down on his lip to stop himself from grinning stupidly.
"yeah?"
he asks, a little redundantly.
he knows what he looks like, with his stomach sunk in and his ribs visible, and it is not flattering.
but it still feels good to have taehyung take care of him, to hear him whisper sweet nothings into his skin.
taehyung hums and plunges his finger deeper.
twisting and crooking it to stretch yoongi open, he presses a kiss to the side of yoongi’s cheek.
"the prettiest," he whispers, cool breath ghosting over yoongi’s ear, before he adds in another finger and gives it a little pressure.
yoongi’s next inhale is shaky, slow, and uncurling his fist from where it’d been tightly clutching the bedsheet, yoongi cups the back of taehyung’s neck with his palm and brings his face closer.
he presses a soft kiss to the gentle bow in taehyung’s lip.
"fuck me," he slurs, and it slants into a breathy moan when taehyung’s fingers curl inside him.
"c’mon, i’m ready."
two fingers are nowhere near enough of a stretch for taehyung, but they both know yoongi likes it like this.
and with the oppressive reminder of their remaining time together, yoongi doesn’t want to have taehyung’s fingers inside him any longer.
still, yoongi makes a soft whine at the loss when taehyung pulls out of him without protest.
he watches taehyung as he lifts his hips, and grabbing his cock with one hand, slowly guides it between yoongi’s folds.
yoongi jolts, shoulders shaking, and mutes his moan into his pillow as taehyung bottoms out in one steady stroke.
both of his legs lock around the back of taehyung’s strong thighs, trembling in turn with yoongi’s gasps of taehyung’s name.
